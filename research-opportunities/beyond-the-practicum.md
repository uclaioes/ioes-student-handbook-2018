# Beyond the Practicum

All environmental science students participate in the Senior Practicum, the year-long capstone program that pairs teams of seniors with real-world clients to deliver science-based solutions for pressing environmental issues (see, Practicum). As exceptional as that experience is, some students choose to go beyond the Practicum by getting directly involved in research being conducted by UCLA’s world-class faculty. We encourage you to explore different possibilities available on campus.

A multitude of research possibilities are open to you as undergraduates, but to get involved takes some initiative and legwork. Often, professors and researchers doing work that would be of interest to you have smaller labs than those in more traditional disciplines like biology, psychology, or medical fields. The PIs (Primary Investigators, or lead faculty members) are interested in mentoring students who have some background in the field already, and this generally means students who have taken their course(s). First and second year students should not despair, however! There are programs at UCLA that are tailored to getting you involved in research.

## [Undergraduate Research Centers](#undergraduate-research-centers)

There are two Undergraduate Research Centers, one for the Sciences and one for Humanities/Social Sciences:

[http://www.ugeducation.ucla.edu/urhass/default.htm](http://www.ugeducation.ucla.edu/urhass/default.htm)

Both of these centers post open research opportunities. While these opportunities may not directly relate to environmental science, they can be invaluable experiences that introduce you to lab procedures and safety, collaborative work, specific research skills, and exposure to the professional research environment that can serve you well when looking for opportunities later. Researchers prefer to take on students with experience in these areas, so even if you start off doing something unrelated to your professional or academic goals, the experience you gain in these labs can make a huge difference.

## [Sustainable LA Grand Challenges Research Program](#sustainable-la-grand-challenges-research-program)

There is also a unique opportunity to get involved in faculty-driven sustainability research, through the Sustainable LA Grand Challenges Research Program. Designed to get students in the early stages of their education, particularly 2nd & 3rd years, involved in faculty research, this program pairs students with faculty researchers working on projects to develop the technologies, policies, and strategies to make LA County sustainable by 2050. You must apply to the program in the spring; the program begins in fall and is an annual commitment. If accepted, you will be assisted in finding a PI/mentor and you will also attend a course each quarter that will provide additional instruction and mentoring.

## [IoES Faculty Research](#ioes-faculty-research)

If you are more certain of your academic goals, we encourage you to directly approach faculty with whom you are interested in pursuing research. Many faculty are willing to take on undergraduate research assistants and/or place you with a graduate student or postdoctoral researcher working in their lab who needs assistance.

The best way to get to know faculty is to take a class, if possible, and be an active participant. Ask relevant questions in class, go to office hours to discuss your interest in the material, and of course, do well in the class. Most faculty find their undergraduate research assistants from the students they know. If it’s not possible to take a class with a faculty member, _do your research on their research_. You can look up a lot of information online. IoES has an extensive “People” section with useful biographies, descriptions of research interests, and links to faculty CVs and publications.

Above all, if you are seeking a research position, don’t be too shy to ask! Don’t worryfaculty expect to be approached about their research and opportunities they might have for students. Be prepared when you do approach them - do not go in and ask “what research do you do?”, read their website and papers for yourself and go in with enthusiasm for what they do. Ask them at least one really good question about their work, or even better, pitch a new idea. Yes, you will have ideas they have not thought of! And even if they have thought of it, they will be impressed.

Not sure where to start? Take a look at the [IoES research centers](https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/centers-and-initiatives/) or extensive [network of other sustainability-related UCLA research centers](https://www.sustain.ucla.edu/our-initiatives/education-and-research/research-centers/) to find faculty working in an area of your greatest interest.

## [Sustainability Action Research](#sustainability-action-research)

For a more student-centered research opportunity, the Sustainability Action Research (SAR) program might be a great fit. SAR is a student-initiated, student-designed, and student-facilitated research program offered through IoES. In the winter and spring quarters of each academic year, students on SAR teams are partnered with a campus stakeholder to research, rethink, investigate, and tackle UCLA’s greatest sustainability issues. Applications are due in the fall.

## [99/199 Research Units](#99-199-research-units)

Students pursuing lower-division research opportunities typically do so through the Undergraduate Research Centers and enroll in Student Research Program (SRP) 99 units with the assistance of the Undergraduate Research Center (URC).

Students pursuing research in their field of study, such as with an IoES faculty researcher, can do so either on a volunteer basis or it may be useful to you as a student to pursue an independent study course, particularly if you are pursuing your own original research under the guidance of a faculty member or have a significant role in the research being undertaken by the faculty member. In these cases, you can enroll in Environment 199 - Independent Study as a contract course. In consultation with the faculty advisor and the department SAO, you will design the course of study and create a unique contract course through the Contract Course function on MyUCLA. This contract is then signed by the faculty member and then brought to the SAO Royce Dieckmann to approve the contract and enroll you in the course. This should be done no later than the end of the 2nd week of the quarter in which the contract course will be taken.
