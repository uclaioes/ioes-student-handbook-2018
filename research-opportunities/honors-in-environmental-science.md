# Honors in Environmental Science

The Honors Program in environmental science is intended to provide exceptional students the opportunity for advanced research and study, under the guidance of a faculty member, leading to the completion of an honors thesis. To qualify for graduation with honors, students must complete all requirements for the major, have a cumulative grade‐point average of 3.5 or better in upper division course work in the major, have an overall grade‐point average of 3.0 or better, complete at least eight units of Environment 198 taken over at least two quarters, and produce a completed, satisfactory honors thesis paper. The honors thesis requirements are in addition to the requirement of a completed Practicum in Environmental Science project.

See the complete Guidelines for Departmental Honors in Environmental Science in the Appendix.
