## Getting your degree in Environmental Science at UCLA

> ** “You Live in the Age of Environmental Science – Seize It” **

![](.gitbook/assets/la-river-1600w.jpg)

# Welcome from director

You have all heard or read the mantra – billions more people to be added to the planet, water scarcity, global warming, species going extinct, and on and on. It makes one wonder, what is the point. At IoES we see that gloomy mantra as a challenge, not a forecast or prophecy. There are more green business jobs than ever before. Venture capital funds and pension funds are investing in sustainable businesses all around the world. The Kentucky Coal Museum has installed solar panels for its energy. Cities are expanding urban parks at an unprecedented rate. Los Angeles is starting the most ambitious river restoration project ever undertaken in the world. The 2028 Olympics hosted in Los Angeles will leave a legacy of sustainability in one of the most biodiverse and culturally diverse corners of the world.

It is always the young that are agents of change. At IoES we are committed to giving you the tools and skills, and the intellectual sophistication to tackle really, really complex environmental problems. We do not just want you to succeed, we expect you to succeed and we will help you exceed. This guidebook is complicated because there are so many different pathways to making an environmental difference, and so many different disciplines that can be your vehicle. One thing that cuts across all environmental advance and progress is the need to excel at communication — that means telling stories and visualizing information in compelling ways. It also mean listening. UCLA is a big university. Take advantage of that to hear different views and to try your hand at telling stories about the environment. Again we will help.

Lastly, as someone who has worked for the federal government, for non-profit organizations, for private business, and for nearly ten different universities, I want to assure you that if you embrace the intellectual challenges and cultural diversity of IoES, there is a career for you – a career that is fun, rewarding, and makes a difference.

Best of luck on what will surely be a tortuous journey. A straight line might be the shortest path, but rarely is it the most interesting path.

# About the IoES

The mission of the UCLA Institute of the Environment and Sustainability \(IoES\) is to advance cross-disciplinary research, teaching, and public service on environmental matters of critical importance. The environment is defined broadly to include the interrelated issues of global climate change, loss of biological diversity, and threats to human health and well-being from the use and misuse of natural resources. We apply the tools of scientific and policy analysis, as well as moral and aesthetic values, to our endeavors.

The environment is a crucial component of sustainability, which is defined as the simultaneous consideration of environmental, economic, and social concerns. Los Angeles itself is a vital asset to this mission. As an international mega-city located in one of the world’s most biologically diverse regions, Los Angeles is a magnet for scholars from around the world who are confronting similar issues of pollution, access to potable water, demand for energy, fragmentation of habitat, and the need to restore ecological function to sprawling urban settlements in a manner that supports economic growth and that is socially just and equitable.

IoES offers creative, multidisciplinary academic programs and courses that address the full complexity of current environmental problems and sustainable solutions. The bachelor of science degree in environmental science is a dual-component degree program for students seeking a challenging and invigorating science curriculum. The first component, the Environmental Science major, provides students with disciplinary breadth in several areas important to environmental science. The second component, a minor or concentration in one of seven defined environmental science areas, provides students with focused disciplinary depth in an area of their choosing.

Unlike a department that focuses on a specific field of inquiry, IoES draws together faculty experts from across the campus. There are currently over 100 faculty affiliated with Institute, representing more than 25 departments. Through our eight research centers and our local, national, and international programs, we employ innovative, cross-disciplinary approaches to address critical environmental and sustainability challenges.

IoES is committed to facilitating student participation in solving real-world sustainability problems. Drawing on the dynamism of the world’s most diverse megacity and our top-tier public university, we take students of all cultures and income levels beyond campus borders to partner with leading government, non-profit, and business entities to develop cutting-edge environmental solutions.

Today’s environmental challenges are too big to leave any idea unexplored. They are too pressing to exclude provocative or even unpopular ideas. For these reasons, IoES sponsors events that stimulate public dialogue on topics including nuclear energy, genetically modified organisms and the future of cars and transportation.

We thrive on the energy, optimism and impatience of our students and faculty. We envision a future that is beautiful and prosperous in 2050—air, water, food, people and nature. As humanity urbanizes, the story of how we save the planet will be written by cities like Los Angeles, by multicultural universities like UCLA, and by innovators who break down silos of disciplinary scholarship. Students at IoES, you, are part of that story.

# The Environmental Science Major

![UCLA IoES Students](../.gitbook/assets/junior-retreat-2017-231.jpg)

# About The Major

The bachelor’s degree in environmental science is an immersive, multifaceted, educational experience. Drawing on the resources of a diverse, world-class university in UCLA, it emphasizes real-world practice—getting students off campus to solve problems with companies, organizations and communities. Along the way, students create their experience, using the campus, city and vast natural areas of California as living laboratories. After they graduate, 80 percent of our students go on to work in environmental professions, while others use what they’ve learned to pursue careers in social science, business, the arts, and more.

The classroom portion of the degree is rooted in physical and life sciences, including foundational courses in chemistry, biology, mathematics, and physics. And because environmental issues are human issues, all students also take multiple classes in social sciences and humanities—learning subjects such as public policy, politics, journalism, and environmental justice. To make this happen, IoES partners with departments across campus. Students are also offered unparalleled opportunities to engage with global experts who visit UCLA and observe cutting-edge research at lectures and symposiums, or to potentially participate in that research with IoES and partner faculty. This broad education prepares our students to take on the complex, pressing environmental issues the world faces.

## Interdisciplinary Major {#interdisciplinary-major}

The study and practice of environmental science are by nature interdisciplinary pursuits, and the B.S. program draws on strong connections across numerous departments at UCLA that all touch on the environmental science field. At their core, environmental issues are human issues. Rooted in life and physical sciences, our curriculum also features multiple classes in social sciences and humanities—subjects such as public policy, politics, journalism, and environmental justice. This gives students a broad perspective and tools to take on today’s most complex, urgent environmental challenges. Students will take upper division courses in areas covering:

* Atmospheric and Water Science
* Climate Science
* Earth Science
* Ecology and Conservation Biology
* Environmental Management, and
* Pollutant Sources, Treatment, Fate and Transport

In addition, students will take courses on the politics and policy of environmental issues, and on anthropogenic forces or human interactions with the environment in the areas of:

* Policy and Politics
* Humans and the Environment

Students also participate in a 1-unit Environmental Science Colloquium series that bring faculty from within the UCLA community and experts from outside organizations and government agencies to present on topics relevant to environmental science.

## Minors {#minors}

Environmental science students play a large role in directing their own education. In addition to taking upper division classes across a variety of environmental disciplines, students choose one of seven minors/concentrations, which are indicated on their diplomas, to develop a deep expertise:

* Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences
* Conservation Biology
* Environmental Engineering
* Environmental Health
* Environmental Systems and Society
* Geography/Environmental Studies
* Earth and Environmental Science

## Senior Practicum {#senior-practicum}

Our students learn by doing, getting off-campus to solve problems over a full year with the one-of-a-kind Senior Practicum. This capstone experience is like no other, bonding students, faculty and professionals as they work in small teams to solve real-world problems. Recent practicum teams have worked to:

* Develop sustainable aquaculture models, with The Nature Conservancy
* Assess health and community Impacts of urban oil drilling in south Los Angeles, with STAND-LA
* Draft plans to connect fragmented habitat threatened by climate change in and around Sequoia National Park, with the U.S. National Park Service
* Develop a model and economic blueprint for sustainable ebony production in central Africa, with Taylor Guitars and Madinter

# Declaring the Major

For students who enter UCLA as freshmen, declaring the Environmental Science major is usually a relatively simple matter.

If already enrolled in another major within the College of Letters and Science, there is no need to inform the current major department of the change of major. However, if enrolled in a major in any other college or school at UCLA, such as Engineering or Arts, the process is more involved.

[**Make an Appointment to Declare the Major**](https://calendly.com/rdieckmann/30min/)

## Major Declaration in the College of Letters and Science {#major-declaration-in-the-college-of-letters-and-science}

The requirements for a student to change their major to Environmental Science are as follows:

If within the first two years of study, the student must:

* Be in good academic standing \(not on academic probation or subject to dismissal\)
* Be making progress in the preparatory courses
* Be able to complete all remaining program requirements within the unit maximum of 216 \(including GE/College requirements, major, and minor/concentration requirements, as well as any other program such as additional minors or majors\)
* Not have 2 or more preparatory courses with grades below C-, or an overall GPA in the major preparatory courses below 2.0.

If the above conditions are met the student can in most cases declare the major by making an appointment with the SAO.

If in the third year of study \(immediately following spring quarter of the second year\) or if any of the above conditions are not met, the student will need to consult with the department SAO about what steps must be taken to qualify to declare the major. It may be a simple matter of catching up with some coursework or preparing a viable academic plan. In other cases, a petition may need to be filed with the department asking for an exception to a department regulation, or a petition may be required by the College, such as in cases where a student will exceed the unit maximum or time to degree.

## Major Declaration from another School at UCLA {#major-declaration-from-another-school-at-ucla}

In addition to meeting the bulleted requirements above, for a student to change their major to Environmental Science while enrolled in another school, such as Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science \(HSSEAS\), Arts & Architecture, Music, or Theater Film & Television, requires that the student first obtain a change of program form and degree planner from the College Academic Counseling office at Murphy Hall, Room A316. The Environmental Science counselor will help prepare and review the plan, and if acceptable will sign it indicating departmental approval. The petition will then be returned to the College, which makes the determination whether the student will be permitted to transfer to the College and into the Environmental Science major.

## Readmission {#readmission}

Students who have completed readmission coursework and wish to change majors to Environmental Science are always reviewed on a case-by-case basis. In most cases the bulleted requirements above must be met and if in violation of departmental regulations a petition must be filed and approved by the department in advance of any petition to the College. Students seeking readmission with the Environmental Science major should make an appointment with the IoES SAO, Royce Dieckmann, to determine eligibility to enter the major.

## Dismissal and Minimum Standards {#dismissal-and-minimum-standards}

A student may be dismissed from the major, be denied permission to enter the major, or may be denied his or her degree, depending on which of the conditions below have been violated.

1. Earns grades below C- in two or more of the major preparatory courses
2. Earns a GPA below 2.0 in the preparatory courses
3. Earns a grade below C in Environment 180A
4. Earns below a 2.0 GPA in the major overall, and in the upper-division requirements for the major

A student in violation of rules 1, 2, and 3 can petition the IoES Undergraduate Academic Committee for an exception, which is reviewed on a case-by-case basis. If rule 4 is violated, the student must petition the College for an exception to graduate or must make up the courses necessary to bring their GPA over 2.0. In any of the above cases, consult with the IoES SAO.

# The Preparatory Courses

The preparatory courses for the Environmental Science major are typical for any bachelor’s of science program. The major requires 13 total prep courses. We recommend that students entering UCLA as freshmen take two prep courses each quarter until all 13 are completed, which will satisfy all of the prep requirements by the end of the second year of study.

## Introduction to Environmental Science {#introduction-to-environmental-science}

_Required:_ Environment M10 _or_ Earth Planetary and Space Sciences 1.

Students may choose between Environment M10 – Introduction to Environmental Science, or Earth, Planetary, and Space Sciences 1 – Introduction to Earth Science. We strongly urge students to complete this requirement in the first or second year of study, or as soon as possible during junior year for transfer students.

For the majority of students, we recommend Environment M10. M10 covers earth science, atmospheric science, oceanography, and some conservation, policy, and other environmental issues. It is usually offered only in fall quarter. However, students who complete the GE Cluster M1 series \(Food: Lens for Environment and Sustainability\) may find the course slightly redundant, and for those students or for those with a strong interest in the Earth Sciences, the EPSS 1 course, which focuses more on geology and oceanography, may be a suitable alternate.

### AP Credit {#ap-credit}

No AP credit equivalent to either course.

### Introduction to Environmental Science Course Descriptions {#introduction-to-environmental-science-course-descriptions}

_**Environment M10. Introduction to Environmental Science**_**.** \(4\) \(Same as Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences M10.\) Lecture, three hours; laboratory, one hour. Limited to undergraduate students. Introduction to environmental science as discipline and as a way of thinking. Discussion of critical environmental issues at local and global scales. Fundamentals of physical, chemical, and biological processes important to environmental science. Laboratory exercises to augment lectures. Letter grading.

_**Earth, Planetary, and Space Sciences 1. Introduction to Earth Science**. _\(5\) Lecture, three hours; laboratory, two hours; field days. Not open to students with credit for or currently enrolled in course 100 or former courses 1F and 1H. Elements of Earth science; study of Earth materials; nature and interpretation of geologic evidence; study of geologic processes; historical aspects of geology. Mandatory field trips introduce students to solving of geologic problems in field. P/NP or letter grading.

## Mathematics \(Calculus\) {#mathematics-calculus}

_Required:_ Math 31A and 31B _or_ Math 3A and 3B.

_Additional courses, depending on minor/concentration:_ Math 32A _or_ 3C.

The major requires that all students take either Math 31A and 31B or Math 3A and 3B. Math 32A or 3C is required for the Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, Environmental Engineering, and Earth and Environmental Science concentrations, and is an option for the Environmental Systems and Society and the Geography/Environmental Studies concentrations.

Math is fundamental to the study of all other science core courses; as such it is recommended that students enroll in the Math courses among the earliest prep courses taken. The two series – 31 and 3 – are similar, but students who do not feel especially strong in calculus may prefer the 3-series.

### Switching Math Series {#switching-math-series}

Students may currently move between the math series courses. For example, if a student took Math 31A, they can then enroll in Math 3B to complete the series. If the student took Math 3B, they may enroll in Math 32A. There are some disadvantages to switching series, primarily due to the order in which the material is taught, so students who switch should be prepared for additional challenge.

Note that there have been changes proposed for the Math 3ABC series that may change the ability of students to switch between series. We will make every attempt to notify students if or when these changes take effect.

### Math & Environmental Engineering {#math-environmental-engineering}

Students interested in pursuing the Environmental Engineering concentration are urged to take Math 32A rather than 3C. 32A leads to second-year calculus courses that students who may decide they wish to pursue graduate study in Environmental Engineering will need to take. Math 3C does not permit students to enroll in these second-year calculus courses.

### AP Credit {#ap-credit-0}

Students who earned a 5 score on the Calculus AB exam will have earned credit for Math 31A. Students who earned a score of 5 on the BC exam will have credit for Math 31A and 31B, while a score of 4 earns Math 31A credit.

### Life Science 30A and 30B {#life-science-30a-and-30b}

The Life Sciences Division has created an alternate math series as another option that they feel provides a mathematics background appropriate for students in the Division’s majors. These courses have not been approved for the Environmental Science major as an official component of the major. However, students who have completed these courses prior to enrolling in the ES major, or who strongly feel that these courses will be of greater benefit than the traditional calculus courses, are permitted to take these two courses in lieu of the Math series above. It is very important for students to be aware that taking the LS 30A/B courses will limit their choice of minor/concentration. Students taking LS 30A/B will not be permitted to pursue the Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, Environmental Engineering, or Earth and Environmental Science minors/concentrations \(unless the student also takes the calculus series\). Additionally, the Math Department does not allow students taking LS 30A/B to then take either Math 3C or 32A.

### Mathematics Course Descriptions {#mathematics-course-descriptions}

## Chemistry {#chemistry}

_Required_: Chemistry 14A, 14B, and 14BL _or_ 20A, 20B, and 20L

_Additional courses, depending on minor/concentration:_ Chemistry 14C _or_ 30A

Like calculus, chemistry is fundamental to environmental science and a strong science foundation for any B.S. program. As with math, we recommend that the Chemistry series be started during the first year of study. For most students in the Environmental Science major, the 14-series is recommended, primarily because it introduces organic chemistry earlier.

Chemistry is the most versatile of the prep courses in regards to the concentrations, because Chemistry 14C or 30A can be applied to any of them. It is required for Conservation Biology and Environmental Health Sciences, and an option for all others.

Students generally cannot switch Chemistry series once a course in either series has been completed. It is therefore imperative that students choose the series wisely; for most Environmental Science majors we recommend the 14-series.

### AP Credit {#ap-credit-1}

No course equivalency is granted for AP scores in Chemistry.

## Life Science {#life-science}

_Students admitted 16F or earlier:_

_Required_: Life Sciences 1 _and_ 2

_Additional courses, depending on minor/concentration:_ Life Sciences 3 _and_ 23L

_Students admitted 17F or after:_

_Required:_ Life Sciences 7A _and_ 7B

_Additional courses, depending on minor/concentration_: Life Science 7C _and_ 23L.

Otherwise known as “Biology,” Life Sciences at UCLA is divided in a rather unique way when compared to the offerings at many other universities. Because of this, students should consult with the IoES SAO or the Life Sciences Core Office \(lscore@lifesci.ucla.edu\) prior to enrolling in any courses at any other institution intended to substitute for the UCLA courses.

### Life Science 1 / 2 or 7A / 7B? {#life-science-1-2-or-7a-7b}

Environmental Science majors have historically been required to take Life Sciences \(LS\) 1 and 2, with students wishing to pursue the Conservation Biology or Environmental Health concentrations required to also take LS 3 and 23L. However, the Life Sciences Division recently introduced a new series that is set to replace the LS 1-4 series: the 7A/B/C series. Students who entered UCLA in fall of 2016 or earlier have the choice to complete either series. If the LS 1-2-3 series was started in the 2016-17 academic year, it should be completed by the end of the 2017-18 academic year, as this series of courses will be discontinued. Any student admitted fall 2017 or later, or any student who has not yet begun the series before fall 2017, should take the LS 7A/B/C series.

### Who takes Life Science 23L? {#who-takes-life-science-23l}

Students wishing to pursue the Conservation Biology or Environmental Health concentrations must take LS 3 and 23L or LS 7C and 23L. 23L is the lab component previously included with LS 2 and LS 3. This 2 unit lab course is best taken concurrently with LS 3 or 7C. All students wishing to take LS 3 will need to take Chem 14C or 30A since completing it is a prerequisite for enrolling in LS 3.

### AP Credit {#ap-credit-2}

We do not recognize any AP credit as equivalent to any of the Life Science series courses.

### Life Science Course Descriptions {#life-science-course-descriptions}

_**1. Evolution, Ecology, and Biodiversity.**_\(5\) Lecture, three hours; laboratory, two hours; one field trip. Introduction to principles and mechanisms of evolution by natural selection; population, behavioral, and community ecology; and biodiversity, including major taxa and their evolutionary, ecological, and physiological relationships.

## Statistics {#statistics}

_Required_: Statistics 12 _or_ 13

Statistical analysis is ubiquitous in environmental science, and as such, a course in statistics is required of all Environmental Science majors. The purpose of statistics is to design, construct, and evaluate techniques for analyzing data. The data can be qualitative or quantitative, self-reported or machine-collected, and the motivations can be scientific, commercial, legal, or policy driven.

The two recommended Statistics courses are largely similar; both will provide a background that is appropriate for the types of analysis students will undertake in the major. Statistics 12 is also a Social Analysis GE, while Statistics 13 is not a GE. On the other hand, 12 is a smaller class and is usually offered only once a year, so it is typically easier to enroll in 13.

Students who are planning to double major or take a minor that requires a different statistics course should consult with the IoES SAO prior to enrolling in any other statistics course. Usually we can accommodate such requirements as a substitution, particularly when the other department has a strict requirement, such as the Economics and Psychology departments. Transfer students who have already taken a lower-division statistics course must inform the IoES SAO so that credit can be applied. All other students must submit a substitution request to the IoES SAO prior to enrolling in any Statistics course other than 12 or 13.

### AP Credit {#ap-credit-3}

We do not recognize any AP credit as equivalent to either Statistics course or to fulfill the Statistics requirement for the major prep.

### Statistics Course Descriptions {#statistics-course-descriptions}

_**12. Introduction to Statistical Methods for Geography and Environmental Studies.**_\(5\) Lecture, four hours; discussion, one hour; laboratory, one hour. Not open for credit to students with credit for course 10, 11, or 13. Introduction to statistical thinking and understanding, with emphasis on techniques used in geography and environmental science. Underlying logic behind statistical procedures, role of variation in statistical thinking, strengths and limitations of statistical summaries, and fundamental inferential tools. Emphasis on applications in geography and environmental science in laboratory work using professional statistical analysis package, including spatial statistics. P/NP or letter grading.

_**13. Introduction to Statistical Methods for Life and Health Sciences.**_** **\(5\) Lecture, three hours; discussion, one hour; laboratory, one hour. Not open for credit to students with credit for course 10, 10H, 11, 12, or 14. Presentation and interpretation of data, descriptive statistics, introduction to correlation and regression and to basic statistical inference \(estimation, testing of means and proportions, ANOVA\) using both bootstrap methods and parametric models. P/NP or letter grading.

## Physics {#physics}

Students admitted 16F or earlier:

_Required:_ Physics 6A _and_ 6B, _or_ Physics 1A _and_ 1B

_Additional courses, depending on minor/concentration_: Physics 6C _or_ 1C

Students admitted 17F or later:

_Required:_ Physics 5A _and_ 5C, _or_ Physics 1A _and_ 1B

_Additional courses, depending on minor/concentration_: Physics 5B _or_ 1C

Physics is the study of the forces and laws of nature, from the largest galaxies to the tiniest subatomic particles. It's the most fundamental science, since the laws of nature determine everything else, forming the basis of chemistry and ultimately of biology, organisms, and ecosystems. It also encompasses electricity and magnetism. Advances in these and other areas of physics have made electric power, industry, electronic devices, and our modern standard of living possible.

Students earn their foundation in Physics through the pursuit of one of the course series options. As with Life Sciences, one of these options has recently changed.

### Physics 6A/B/C or 5A/C/B? {#physics-6a-b-c-or-5a-c-b}

Prior to fall 2017, the Life Sciences Physics series was the 6A/B/C series. This series has been reorganized and renumbered starting in fall 2017 as the 5A/B/C series. Students who began the 6-series prior to 17F are encouraged to complete the required courses in the 17-18 academic year, as the series will be discontinued. Students who have not yet started the series should take the 5 series.

For most students in the Environmental Science major, we recommend the 5 \(formerly 6-\) series of Physics. It provides more context and connection for the biological sciences than the 1-series. For students pursuing the Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences or Earth and Environmental Science minor/concentration, the third-quarter Physics course is recommended as additional preparation for the minor. It is especially useful for Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences for the introduction to thermodynamics, which will be important in many upper-division Atmospheric and Oceanic Science courses.

While it is possible to switch between Physics series, it is not recommended.

### AP Credit {#ap-credit-4}

We do not recognize any AP credit as equivalent to any course in the Physics series.

# Upper-Division Major Requirements

Course requirements of the major are structured to provide intellectual breadth and introduce students to the key fields that exist under the umbrella of environmental science, and within each category, to provide course options from multiple departments to expose students to different disciplinary approaches.

We recommend that students use the major requirements to explore the various fields and disciplines available to them before choosing a concentration. Students are encouraged to take courses in the categories of greatest personal interest to them as early as possible.

The upper-division major requirements are divided into four sections:

* Environmental Science \(6 categories\)
  * Atmospheric and Water Science
  * Climate Science
  * Earth Science
  * Ecology & Conservation Biology
  * Environmental Management
  * Pollutant Sources, Treatment, Fate and Transport
* Social Science - Humanities \(2 categories\)
  * Policy & Politics
  * Humans and the Environment
* Colloquium \(4 units\)
* Practicum \(3 courses\)

The first two sections, Environmental Science and Social Science - Humanities, are composed primarily of lecture-style courses, although there are also lab and field courses amongst these. Students are required to take 8 courses across 8 different categories within these two sections. Details and course descriptions are listed below

Students are required to take four Colloquium units from a set of course options that are designed to bring students in the major together and expose them to the myriad of possibilities for careers, research, engagement and involvement with environmental matters of all types through a lecture series. These courses are primarily one unit, P/NP graded and consist of a guest lecture.

The Senior Practicum is a year-long series that is the capstone to the major. The three courses are taken over fall, winter and spring quarters in the student’s final year.

Note: Students do not need to complete the entirety of their prep courses prior to beginning upper-division major requirements. However, courses may have prerequisites or recommended requisites that students should complete or consider before enrolling.

## Course Options {#course-options}

### Multiple Listed Courses {#multiple-listed-courses}

Courses where the course number is preceded by an “M” are mutliple-listed between more than one department. The course description notes which department and course number where the other offering\(s\) of the course may be found. Students may enroll in the course under any of the departments offering it and will receive the same credit.

### Substitutions and Petitions {#substitutions-and-petitions}

Students wishing to substitute a course, either one found at UCLA or from another institution, can submit a petition to IoES for consideration. It is best if this is done in advance on an advisory basis. Simply send an email to the IoES SAO with your request in the following format:

_Subject line: Petition for \[category\]_

_I would like to use \[course\] from \[institution\] to be taken in \[term/year\] for the \[category requirement\]._

Attach a syllabus if available, or include a course description or links to course information. The more information you can provide about the course the easier it is for a determination to be made.

### Program Plan {#program-plan}

# Senior Practicum

## Overview {#overview}

The three-quarter Practicum in Environmental Science is the capstone educational experience required of all environmental science majors and represents a significant departure from conventional teaching and learning experiences at UCLA.

Designed to launch our students into impactful careers in the environment, the Practicum pairs teams of five to seven seniors with a faculty member or other environmental expert. Then it immerses them in an independent, original, environmental or sustainability research project for prominent clients from outside the university, ranging from The Nature Conservancy and Natural Resources Defense Council, to Northrop Grumman or the National Park Service.** **Clients often return to participate year after year. In addition to providing an unprecedented opportunity for our majors to produce complex, professional quality work while still a student, the Practicum generates valuable information and resources for the clients’ missions.

Faculty advisors attend regular weekly meetings with their teams and may help teams arrange travel and interactions with clients or other experts in the field, as well as offer advice to guide the scope of projects. However, advisors _do not serve as project managers_; their role is more of a mentor and coach—projects do not come with step by step directions! Project leadership and management, and the quality of the final products prepared for clients, are the responsibility of the students on each team. To meet their project’s goals, students will spend part of the year developing professional work habits and skills, which will prepare them for a successful transition to careers in environmental science. Indeed, alumni often say that the Practicum experience is what gave them the edge in getting jobs or into graduate programs.

## 180A: Fall Quarter {#180a-fall-quarter}

## Lectures, Labs, Assigning Teams, and Literature Reviews {#lectures-labs-assigning-teams-and-literature-reviews}

In the first quarter of the capstone sequence, students attend lectures and presentations designed to introduce them to some of the common tools and methodologies of environmental problem solving, building on what they have been exposed to in other courses. Students become familiar with the norms and ethical and policy issues that occur in the professional practice of environmental science, and examine how scientific data and research are used to make decisions in policy, professional, regulatory and other arenas. Students are introduced to their clients and the environmental science and policy questions they will take on in their group projects in ENV 180B and 180C during the winter and spring. Based on their individual preferences and backgrounds, students are assigned to a Practicum project team roughly half way through the quarter.

Course work for the 180A class includes two major components:

* A lab based introduction to data handling, basic statistics and data exploration, and spatial analysis using Geographic Information Systems \(GIS\). Labs, which focus on the application of these tools to environmental problem solving, meet once per week, but students should expect to spend 6-8 hours per week outside of scheduled lab time completing assignments.
* The literature review – after being assigned to a Practicum project, students conduct independent literature reviews of recent scientific and policy research on a specific aspect of their project topic. Students effectively ask the question “what do we know, or not know about a particular issue?” This differs from most research papers or essays students have written in previous classes; the literature review does not involve developing and supporting a thesis. Instead, students conduct a critical analysis on the current state of research, including reviewing any gaps in knowledge and problems with research methodologies, or any controversies or major disagreements in the field, to prepare themselves for tackling their Practicum project in 180B/C.

## 180B/C: Winter and Spring Quarters {#180b-c-winter-and-spring-quarters}

## Proposals, Research, Presentations, Final Reports {#proposals-research-presentations-final-reports}

During winter and spring, students work as a team on their client-based environmental projects, diving into real-life application of multi-disciplinary problem solving. Project work includes formulation of a formal research proposal providing detail on how the team will meet the project’s goals, conducting research, and development of presentations and a final report and other work product that will be defined in collaboration with the client. Depending on the nature of the project, work may include field work or reconnaissance, including travel outside of the Los Angeles area, original data collection and analysis, close collaboration with your client and other experts and stakeholders in the field, and learning any number of skills or analytical approaches necessary to complete the project. In some cases, a team’s final research report may provide the basis for a publication in a peer-reviewed journal. In this case, the advisor and client will work with the students after graduation to edit for possible publication.

### Working and managing in a team {#working-and-managing-in-a-team}

Students will be faced with needing to conduct and coordinate work, by multiple team members, on multiple tracks at once, and over a limited timeframe. This is similar to situations encountered in the professional world, where preliminary research may be conducted while efforts to finalize a project framework or proposal are still being completed. In broad terms, it will be important for the success of each project that:

* Students operate independently as a professional team;
* All parties develop a high level of trust and spirit of collaboration;
* Students and faculty are responsive to clients while conducting independent research;
* Communication among team members and between parties is professional and frequent; and
* Possibly most importantly, students feel comfortable to make decisions, make mistakes, and learn from the experience.

Students should expect to devote 12-15 hours a week, on average, to their group project, although more hours in any specific week can be expected depending on the particular needs of each project. This time includes class meeting time and field trips as appropriate for each project. Importantly, to avoid excess workload during spring quarter, each team will need to ensure that progress on their group projects is evenly allocated over the two quarters.

## Substitutions for the Practicum {#substitutions-for-the-practicum}

While the capstone Practicum sequence is the expected path for all environmental science majors, we recognize there may be circumstances that require a student to substitute other coursework or research in lieu of completing part or all of the Practicum program. Any substitution will require a petition to the IoES Academic Committee, and will be evaluated on an individual basis. Please see below for an overview of general IoES policy regarding potential substitutions.

* In order to substitute any portion of the Practicum, students must be in good academic standing and maintain at least a 3.0 GPA in the major.
* All students are expected to complete 180A, the fall Practicum class and associated GIS labs. Students may petition to substitute an independent study course for 180A where the student 1\) plans to substitute coursework or independent research for the 180B/C sequence in place of a Practicum project, and 2\) the student has completed at least an approved introductory GIS course. In this case, and upon an approved petition, the student will be required to complete a literature review paper for credit as independent study. All students who have not previously completed an approved GIS course, however, should plan to enroll in 180A.
* Students may petition to substitute a variety of potential field courses or independent research projects in place of 180B/C and completion of a Practicum project. Programs that have previously been approved for substitution include:
  * Participation in the Marine Biology Quarter \(MBQ\) or Field Biology Quarter \(FBQ\) programs through the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology.
  * Completion of the UC Natural Reserve System field course \(taken in any term, including summer\).

Complete guidelines for Practicum Substitution requests can be found in the Appendix.

# Minor/Concentrations

## About the Minor/Concentration {#about-the-minor-concentration}

The Minor/Concentration provides depth and specific instruction in a particular field of the student’s greatest interest within Environmental Science. The concentration is required of all Environmental Science majors, and students earn a minor on the transcript and diploma when they graduate in six of the seven options.

## Choosing a Minor/Concentration {#choosing-a-minor-concentration}

Students typically decide which minor/concentration to choose based on experiences in the upper-division coursework for the major. To aid in that discovery we recommend choosing the major courses of greatest interest as early as possible to help decide a direction. Most students determine their concentration by the end of the sophomore year or early in the junior year. Students are encouraged to declare the minor prior to reaching 150 total units; after reaching 150 units students will have to make an appointment with their general academic counseling unit \(CAC/AAP/Honors\) for approval.

While the minors provide greater depth in a particular field, they should not be viewed as determining one’s future. The minor/concentration can help students enter a particular field for graduate school or for a professional opportunity, but should always be viewed as potentially opening doors, but not closing others. While a student choosing, for example, Environmental Engineering may go on to become an engineer, the option is still open to pursue public health, law, or almost any other path.

## Minor Unit Requirements {#minor-unit-requirements}

All minor/concentrations, with a little planning, will include the same number of courses. There is no longer or shorter path; all can be completed with 20 units that are unique to the minor. Typically this means that if a minor has 6 courses, one course can overlap with another part of one’s program \(major or another minor\); if it has 7 courses, two can overlap. However, the units are key, so courses that provide fewer than 4 units may change the number of courses one needs to reach 20 unique units in the minor.

## Declaring the Minor/Concentration {#declaring-the-minor-concentration}

Declaring a minor is usually a simple process. First, students should consult with the IoES SAO to declare the concentration, which then tracks progress in DARS. Royce will explain any additional steps the student must take prior to declaring the minor with the department that offers it \(also detailed in the sections for the minors here\).

Substitution requests for minors offered by a department other than the IoES must be made to and approved by that department. Each department has its own preferences for submitting such petitions. Consult with the department SAO for instructions. See the Appendix for a list of all departmental SAO contact information.

## Career Paths – Study What Interests You! {#career-paths-study-what-interests-you}

For many of you, as young scientists, choosing a career path may feel like a daunting challenge, and the decision of what to study to set yourself up for that career equally or even more intimidating. But here’s the good news: there are many, many fantastic career paths available to you after you graduate, whether you continue in environmental science or not, and the minor you pick will not, by itself, predict, or limit, your future. You should feel free to study what interests you, not what you think you need to study because it’s the only path to that exact right job.

According to a recent report by the U.S. Department of labor, on average people tend to change jobs _11 times_ between the ages of 18 and 44, and will change careers altogether two or three times in their lifetime. Your undergraduate education path will not define your career path, rather, it will provide you with a strong background as a scientist or professional in general for you to go forward and discover what it is you want to do.

This is not to say there aren’t reasons to potentially pick one minor over another. This is including whether you plan to potentially go on to a graduate program in a particular scientific discipline or for a professional program; there may be prerequisites you will need to have taken in the program subject area. But even if you decide to change course later, there are almost always opportunities to build the background needed for graduate study in a different field. Just because you minor in conservation biology does not mean you can never get a PhD in climate science! The important thing is to find a course of study will be passionate about, do well, and keep moving forward. Your choice of minor is an important first step, but only a first step toward figuring out what you will do next!

## A Guide to the Environmental Engineering Minor {#a-guide-to-the-environmental-engineering-minor}

General Comments

This minor was originally conceived as a component of the BS in Environmental Science, offered by the Institute of the Environment, but may be of interest to students from other programs.

There are no prerequisite “traps” in the list of courses. The required course CEE 153 has only a recommended prerequisite of MAE 103, but more than a decade of experience has shown that students can achieve well in CEE 153 without having taken MAE 103. All other courses used to satisfy the minor have at most CEE 153 as a prerequisite. However, EHS C125 and C164 do recommend additional chemistry courses.

Unless the twenty unique unit requirement for a minor is lifted, students in HSSEAS majors can use this minor to satisfy only two of the TBR requirements in Civil and Environmental Engineering.

The requirement for a minimum grade of C in each course may be appealed in the case of a C-, but generally not in the case of any D grade. Consideration of appeals in the case of a C- grade will take into account the student’s overall academic record.

Acceptable Course Substitutes

The list of elective courses specified in the minor requirements is limited to courses that may be taken without prerequisites, but many other subjects are appropriate to satisfy this minor. Up to _three_ UCLA courses in the list below will be “automatically” approved as substitutes for the five upper-division elective requirements. Requests for more than three substitutions and for transferred courses will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Note that, because some of the courses listed below may have additional prerequisites, students should consult the instructors of these courses to determine if they have adequate preparation.

_Acceptable course substitutes:_

**AOS** 104 \(acceptable as substitute for CEE 153, but not in addition to CEE 153\), 141 \(credit for both AOS 141 and CEE 163 will not be granted\)

**CEE** 110, 150, 151, 152, 156B, 157A, 157B, 157C, 157L, 157M, 163 **ChE** 100, 101A, 101B, 101C, 102A, 102B, 106, 113, C119, C140 \(credit for both MAE 105A

and ChE 102A will not be granted\) **EHS** C152D **ENV** M114, M134, M153, 157 **EPSS** 101, C113

**MAE** 103, 105A, 105D, 133A, 136, 150A, 150D, 174, 182A, 182B, 182C

Undergraduate Research Opportunities in Environmental Engineering

Students interested in participating in research in the area of environmental engineering are encouraged to contact directly the faculty instructors of the environmental engineering courses to see what research opportunities may be available.

Graduate Study in Environmental Engineering

Students wishing to enter a graduate program in environmental engineering should plan to take several additional courses. The following are the required preparatory courses for admission to the Environmental Engineering Masters Degree program at UCLA:

Chemistry and Biochemistry 20A, 20B, 20L; Mathematics 32A, 32B, 33A, 33B; Physics 1A/4AL, 1B; Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering 103, 105A; Civil and Environmental Engineering 151 or 153. The Chemistry and Biochemistry 14 A/B/BL series, and the Physics 6 A/B series are also acceptable, but the Mathematics 3 A/B series does not lead to the differential equations course 33B, so students are advised to take the 31 A/B series. Any course that includes thermodynamics is acceptable in place of MAE 105A. Note that MAE 103 and 105A, and CEE 151 and 153 are all acceptable requirements for the Environmental Engineering Minor.

Environmental Engineering Masters degree programs at universities other than UCLA should have entrance requirements similar to those of UCLA, but students are encouraged to obtain information specific to the schools to which they plan to apply.

Students interested in environmental engineering careers should also take the Fundamentals of Engineering Exam \(previously called the Engineer-in-Training Exam\) - see [http://ncees.org/exams/fe-exam/](http://ncees.org/exams/fe-exam/). Students without an accredited Bachelors Degree can take this exam \(in spite of what the website implies\). Once the Master’s Degree is completed there is no issue about a non-engineering Bachelors Degree and students can eventually proceed to obtain the Professional Engineers license.

# Environmental Health Concentration

## About the Minor {#about-the-minor-1}

[Environmental Health Sciences, Fielding School of Public Health](https://ehs.ph.ucla.edu/pages/)

Research in Environmental Health Sciences focus on the effects of biological, chemical and physical hazards in the environment on human and ecosystem health, and the means of managing these hazards. Coursework in pollutant sources, treatment, fate and management in the environment – soil, air, water, including urban environments – and the effect these pollutants have on human health is the primary focus of the coursework in this concentration.

SPECIAL NOTE: Unlike the other concentrations in the Environmental Science major, Environmental Health Sciences is NOT a minor. Students completing this concentration will NOT receive a notation on the transcript or diploma. However, students who successfully complete the concentration have been very successful professionally and especially in turning their experience into graduate school admissions. The EHS concentration allows only those few in the Environmental Science major to participate in courses that are otherwise only available to graduate students in Public Health. A high level of achievement in these graduate level courses is impressive to graduate schools in Public Health and related fields, and often yields strong recommendations from the faculty as well. A highly motivated undergraduate who does well in this concentration will absolutely not be disadvantaged by the lack of a minor on his or her record.

## Where are they now? {#where-are-they-now-2}

Environmental science majors who graduated with this concentration are now:

Jobs

* Assistant Environmental Services Specialist - City of San Jose
* Assistant Specialist of Air Pollution Exposure and Epidemiology - UC Irvine

# Special Opportunities

![UCLA IoES](../../.gitbook/assets/special-ops.jpg)

# Summer Session

Summer session is a great way to get ahead, catch up, or help manage your schedule by taking courses at UCLA or elsewhere.

## Summer at UCLA {#summer-at-ucla}

UCLA offers two sessions each summer, A and C session, which run from mid-June through July, and August through mid-September, respectively. Each 6-week session offers a variety of courses, including some that are tough to enroll in during the academic year but are easy to get into in the summer. All units, grades, and course credit automatically applies to your program, so there’s no hassle with sending transcripts or finding compatible equivalent courses, and you can be assured you’ll get the quality instruction you’ve come to expect at UCLA.

The official UCLA Summer Sessions schedule is on-line in January and registration for UCLA students begins in February. Two courses in a session is considered a full-time load due to the condensed nature of Summer Sessions.

UCLA summer session fees are charged on a per-unit fee basis. The unit maximum for summer is 18 units total, whether taken in a single session or multiple, although this can be increased with a petition to the College of L&S at A316 Murphy Hall.

Financial aid is also available in summer; there is a unit minimum \(6\) and applications start in February, so don’t wait to apply for aid.

[https://www.summer.ucla.edu/](https://www.summer.ucla.edu/)

## Summer at a Community College {#summer-at-a-community-college}

Taking summer courses at a **Community College** can be a low-cost and possibly local alternative for those who will be away from Los Angeles in the summer. Each community college releases its schedule for summer on different dates and enrollment is specific to the school. Community colleges only offer lower-division courses, so they can be a great way to complete GE requirements, language, or some lower-div prep courses, but in all cases you must consult with either the College \(for GE/language\) or the department to determine which courses will transfer to fulfill requirements.

Grades do not transfer from community colleges, although you must earn at least a C to get credit. Units will transfer until you reach 105 total units, after which time you can no longer accrue units from community college courses. This can be a good thing, as it can help keep your unit count below the maximum if you intend to take on an ambitious program or have taken many courses already. Course credit can apply but again, you must consult with the proper office to insure that the correct course for the requirement you wish to fulfill is being taken.

## Summer at another University {#summer-at-another-university}

Summer courses can also be taken at **another 4-year university**. There are thousands of public and private universities in the United States that offer summer session; therefore all courses taken at any other university must be approved in advance by petition to the department \(for major or minor courses\) or the College \(for GE/College requirements\).

If taken at any other University of California campus, in addition to course credit, the units and grades will transfer and affect your UC GPA. If taken at any other university, units and course credit can transfer but the grades will not affect your UC GPA \(although at least a “C” grade is required to earn credit\). As with Community Colleges, a transcript must be sent to UCLA following completion of the courses.

# Study Abroad

The IoES encourages students to explore the many opportunities for study abroad available through UCLA and other campuses and organizations.

## UC Education Abroad Program {#uc-education-abroad-program}

UC EAP is a UC-systemwide Education Abroad Program that specializes in semester or year-long study abroad at foreign universities. You can choose from hundreds of universities located in dozens of countries across the globe.

When choosing where to go, consider what is unique, special, and intriguing to you about the places you are considering and think about what sort of experience you want to have. Once you’ve figured that out, we here at the IoES can work with you and the EAP counselors to find the best fit for you. We can help figure out courses for you to take, so don’t become preoccupied with that.

For semester-length UC EAP programs, you will go, usually alone, to the foreign university and take the same courses with the resident population of students. It is an immersive experience in the culture, climate, and people of the location you choose. This type of cultural immersion is exciting and often a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, but it also requires maturity on the part of the participant as you will be away from nearly everything familiar to you for many months.

Because the Practicum occurs throughout senior year, we recommend that students plan for semester abroad programs like EAP to take place either during the Junior year, or in fall of a 5th year \(13th semester\) if that is viable for you. Fall is often favorable because you trade a fall quarter for a fall semester; spring semesters straddle the UCLA winter and spring quarter. However, this should be only one factor in your decision, which should also include the climate/season, finances, and other considerations.

## Travel Study {#travel-study}

Travel Study, like EAP, offers students a unique experience, but usually these programs are shorter, focus on a specific site or topic of study in a region, and the majority of students and instructors will be from U.S. universities. Programs as short as one week or as long as a semester are available through travel study programs.

UCLA offers some in the summer, although at the moment we do not have any environment-specific travel study options. UC Davis, on the other hand, has many terrific summer programs that go to a variety of locales. In addition, other universities offer travel study programs that are open to any students in the USA and there are also privately run organizations that offer travel study.

Students should check with counselors both in the department appropriate to the field of study and in UC EAP to help determine transferability of any non-UC program.

## UC Natural Reserve System: California Ecology and Conservation Field Course {#uc-natural-reserve-system-california-ecology-and-conservation-field-course}

The UC Natural Reserve System is a network of protected natural areas throughout California. Its 39 sites include more than 756,000 acres, making it the largest university-administered reserve system in the world. Most major state ecosystems are represented, from coastal tidepools to inland deserts, and lush wetlands to redwood forests. The reserves also serve as a gateway to more than a million acres of public lands. Founded in 1965 to provide undisturbed environments for research, education, and public service, the Natural Reserve System contributes to the understanding and wise stewardship of the earth.

The California Ecology and Conservation course brings together 27 students from across the UC system for seven weeks of intensive learning at NRS reserves. Guided by experienced field instructors, undergraduates transform into scientists by conducting independent research studies. Students learn to notice natural patterns, frame questions into feasible research projects, and practice standard techniques such as surveys of animal and plant populations. At the conclusion of each project, students analyze their data and present their findings to the class in oral presentations, posters, and reports. Students hone their research, public speaking, and scientific writing skills with constant practice and feedback. All the while, students gain a working familiarity with California’s diverse ecosystems while immersed in the NRS’s classrooms without walls.

California Ecology and Conservation is open to all University of California undergraduates in good standing with their home campus who have at least a 2.5 GPA and have passed an introductory ecology or biology course prior to applying for the program. Students receive 19 units of credit for the term; consult with your major and/or minor department for applicability of credit for your program. The program is offered in spring, summer, and fall.

# Double Majors

Students wishing to double major are best served by identifying the two majors as early as possible in one’s academic career. The key to successfully double-majoring is planning in order to make sure the course load is manageable and to ensure completion within a reasonable time-to-degree, since nearly all double majors will exceed the unit maximum.

Double majors with BS in environmental science are always subject to approval by the College of L&S \(and if in another school at UCLA, such as HSSEAS or AA, approval by that school as well\).

There is a process to declaring a double major. The first step is to devise a plan that accommodates all the courses necessary to complete both majors as well as the other requirements of the school to which you belong. This plan should be vetted by the SAOs from each department in which you will major.

To officially declare a double major, you must complete all preparatory courses for both majors, and at least two unique upper-division courses for each, prior to declaring. At that point you will have both departments review and sign-off on your course plan and then submit that to the College \(and if applicable to the school to which you belong\) for approval.

Up to 5 upper-division courses may overlap between the requirements for the majors involved. There is no limit on lower-division course overlap. The rules for minors still apply: 20 total units must be unique to any minor.

## Other Minors {#other-minors}

In addition to the minor/concentration required of all environmental science majors, students are welcome to pursue any other minor offered at UCLA. The procedure for declaring a minor varies from minor to minor, so always check with the SAO for the department offering the minor.

One requirement is universal to all minors: 20 units must be unique to the minor \(not overlapping with one’s major or another minor\).

# Honors in Environmental Science

The Honors Program in environmental science is intended to provide exceptional students the opportunity for advanced research and study, under the guidance of a faculty member, leading to the completion of an honors thesis. To qualify for graduation with honors, students must complete all requirements for the major, have a cumulative grade‐point average of 3.5 or better in upper division course work in the major, have an overall grade‐point average of 3.0 or better, complete at least eight units of Environment 198 taken over at least two quarters, and produce a completed, satisfactory honors thesis paper. The honors thesis requirements are in addition to the requirement of a completed Practicum in Environmental Science project.

See the complete Guidelines for Departmental Honors in Environmental Science in the Appendix.

# Beyond the Practicum

All environmental science students participate in the Senior Practicum, the year-long capstone program that pairs teams of seniors with real-world clients to deliver science-based solutions for pressing environmental issues \(see, Practicum\). As exceptional as that experience is, some students choose to go beyond the Practicum by getting directly involved in research being conducted by UCLA’s world-class faculty. We encourage you to explore different possibilities available on campus.

A multitude of research possibilities are open to you as undergraduates, but to get involved takes some initiative and legwork. Often, professors and researchers doing work that would be of interest to you have smaller labs than those in more traditional disciplines like biology, psychology, or medical fields. The PIs \(Primary Investigators, or lead faculty members\) are interested in mentoring students who have some background in the field already, and this generally means students who have taken their course\(s\). First and second year students should not despair, however! There are programs at UCLA that are tailored to getting you involved in research.

## Undergraduate Research Centers {#undergraduate-research-centers}

There are two Undergraduate Research Centers, one for the Sciences and one for Humanities/Social Sciences:

[http://www.ugresearchsci.ucla.edu/](http://www.ugresearchsci.ucla.edu/)

[http://www.ugeducation.ucla.edu/urhass/default.htm](http://www.ugeducation.ucla.edu/urhass/default.htm)

Both of these centers post open research opportunities. While these opportunities may not directly relate to environmental science, they can be invaluable experiences that introduce you to lab procedures and safety, collaborative work, specific research skills, and exposure to the professional research environment that can serve you well when looking for opportunities later. Researchers prefer to take on students with experience in these areas, so even if you start off doing something unrelated to your professional or academic goals, the experience you gain in these labs can make a huge difference.

## Sustainable LA Grand Challenges Research Program {#sustainable-la-grand-challenges-research-program}

There is also a unique opportunity to get involved in faculty-driven sustainability research, through the Sustainable LA Grand Challenges Research Program. Designed to get students in the early stages of their education, particularly 2nd & 3rd years, involved in faculty research, this program pairs students with faculty researchers working on projects to develop the technologies, policies, and strategies to make LA County sustainable by 2050. You must apply to the program in the spring; the program begins in fall and is an annual commitment. If accepted, you will be assisted in finding a PI/mentor and you will also attend a course each quarter that will provide additional instruction and mentoring.

Apply here:[https://grandchallenges.ucla.edu/sustainable-la/sla-gc-ursp-2017/](https://grandchallenges.ucla.edu/sustainable-la/sla-gc-ursp-2017/)

## IoES Faculty Research {#ioes-faculty-research}

If you are more certain of your academic goals, we encourage you to directly approach faculty with whom you are interested in pursuing research. Many faculty are willing to take on undergraduate research assistants and/or place you with a graduate student or postdoctoral researcher working in their lab who needs assistance.

The best way to get to know faculty is to take a class, if possible, and be an active participant. Ask relevant questions in class, go to office hours to discuss your interest in the material, and of course, do well in the class. Most faculty find their undergraduate research assistants from the students they know. If it’s not possible to take a class with a faculty member, _do your research on their research_. You can look up a lot of information online. IoES has an extensive “People” section with useful biographies, descriptions of research interests, and links to faculty CVs and publications.

Above all, if you are seeking a research position, don’t be too shy to ask! Don’t worryfaculty expect to be approached about their research and opportunities they might have for students. Be prepared when you do approach them - do not go in and ask “what research do you do?”, read their website and papers for yourself and go in with enthusiasm for what they do. Ask them at least one really good question about their work, or even better, pitch a new idea. Yes, you will have ideas they have not thought of! And even if they have thought of it, they will be impressed.

Not sure where to start? Take a look at the [IoES research centers](https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/centers-and-initiatives/) or extensive [network of other sustainability-related UCLA research centers](https://www.sustain.ucla.edu/our-initiatives/education-and-research/research-centers/) to find faculty working in an area of your greatest interest.

## Sustainability Action Research {#sustainability-action-research}

For a more student-centered research opportunity, the Sustainability Action Research \(SAR\) program might be a great fit. SAR is a student-initiated, student-designed, and student-facilitated research program offered through IoES. In the winter and spring quarters of each academic year, students on SAR teams are partnered with a campus stakeholder to research, rethink, investigate, and tackle UCLA’s greatest sustainability issues. Applications are due in the fall.

[https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/sar/](https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/sar/)

## 99/199 Research Units {#99-199-research-units}

Students pursuing lower-division research opportunities typically do so through the Undergraduate Research Centers and enroll in Student Research Program \(SRP\) 99 units with the assistance of the Undergraduate Research Center \(URC\).

Students pursuing research in their field of study, such as with an IoES faculty researcher, can do so either on a volunteer basis or it may be useful to you as a student to pursue an independent study course, particularly if you are pursuing your own original research under the guidance of a faculty member or have a significant role in the research being undertaken by the faculty member. In these cases, you can enroll in Environment 199 - Independent Study as a contract course. In consultation with the faculty advisor and the department SAO, you will design the course of study and create a unique contract course through the Contract Course function on MyUCLA. This contract is then signed by the faculty member and then brought to the SAO Royce Dieckmann to approve the contract and enroll you in the course. This should be done no later than the end of the 2nd week of the quarter in which the contract course will be taken.

# Honors in Environmental Science

The Honors Program in environmental science is intended to provide exceptional students the opportunity for advanced research and study, under the guidance of a faculty member, leading to the completion of an honors thesis. To qualify for graduation with honors, students must complete all requirements for the major, have a cumulative grade‐point average of 3.5 or better in upper division course work in the major, have an overall grade‐point average of 3.0 or better, complete at least eight units of Environment 198 taken over at least two quarters, and produce a completed, satisfactory honors thesis paper. The honors thesis requirements are in addition to the requirement of a completed Practicum in Environmental Science project.

See the complete Guidelines for Departmental Honors in Environmental Science in the Appendix.

# Getting Involved

When school is in session, UCLA effectively becomes a city of 80,000 people. With its commitment to health and sustainability, the campus has become a living laboratory, taking on issues from renewable energy to water reuse to food sourcing to biodiversity to creating a healthy workforce and more.

The diverse population of greater L.A. is at 18.68 million and growing, yet there is a wealth of nature all around. From the Santa Monica Mountains to the tide pools of Palos Verdes, Los Angeles represents the frontier of urban humanity’s interaction with nature. Water, food supply, energy, pollution and environmental justice are all part of the equation. Many UCLA students engage off campus by volunteering with community groups, teaching LA’s youth about sustainability and the environment, or simply getting out in nature. There are many ways to get involved. Sign up, try it out, make friends, find your passion!

# On Campus

## Environmental Student Network {#environmental-student-network}

The Environmental Student Network \(ESN\) is a UCLA campus student organization dedicated to providing networking opportunities for Environmental Science majors and anyone who wants to be involved in the environmental field in general. ESN additionally provides a setting for environmentally conscious students to come together; ESN holds volunteer events, socials, and hikes throughout the year in an effort to provide students opportunities to become further involved. All majors are welcome—all that's necessary to participate is a passion for the environment and a desire to help!

## Sustainability Talks {#sustainability-talks}

Sustainability Talks is a student-led speaker series offered each Fall quarter as Environment 185A, a 1-unit, pass/no pass course. Student Co-Directors line-up professionals, academics, and activists in sustainable fields such as energy, climate change, air quality, environmental justice, food, transportation, fashion, entertainment, public health technology, film and more. This course is a great way to meet other students, hear from people at the cutting edge of sustainability, and to get ideas for volunteer and internship opportunities.

2017-18 Co-Directors: Ileana Callejas callejas.ileana@yahoo.com  
Mark Biedlingmaier markbieds@gmail.com

This course may be applied toward the Colloquium requirement. Together with Sustainability Action Research \(below\) the courses \(Environment 185 A/B/C\) may be applied toward the Environmental Systems and Society minor.

## Sustainability Action Research Program {#sustainability-action-research-program}

Sustainability Action Research \(SAR\) is a student-initiated, student-designed, and student-facilitated research program offered through the IoES. In a two-quarter sequence of classes in winter and spring \(Environment 185 A/B\), students on SAR teams are partnered with a campus stakeholder to research, rethink, investigate, and tackle UCLA’s greatest sustainability issues. This program is a great way to get involved in real-world research and is kind of like the Practicum, but with UCLA as the client! The program is open to anyone and you enroll by applying to be a team member \(185A\) or a team leader \(185B\). Each year there are 7-8 teams of 5-7 students working with Facilities, Housing, Health System, Transportation, Dining, and others. Enrollment may be competitive depending on demand.

## UCLA Sustainability Office Internships {#ucla-sustainability-office-internships}

The UCLA Sustainability Office has an ongoing, open call for student volunteers wanting to get involved in campus projects. Opportunities range from one-time activities to short term or term projects. You may be able to work directly with Nurit Katz, UCLA Chief Sustainability Officer, or Bonny Bentzin, Deputy Chief Sustainability Officer. Both are wonderful women and are great resources, especially if you are thinking of a career in sustainability.

[https://www.sustain.ucla.edu/get-involved/volunteer/](https://www.sustain.ucla.edu/get-involved/volunteer/)

## The Green Initiative Fund {#the-green-initiative-fund}

Have your own ideas about improving sustainability on campus? You can apply for funding to make them happen through The Green Initiative Fund \(TGIF\), a grant-making fund for sustainability projects on UCLA’s campus. Roughly, $200,000 per year is available for student-initiated sustainability projects on campus. Projects are selected by a committee consisting of students, faculty, and staff in which students have the majority vote. TGIF is funded by a $4 per quarter student fee. The goal of TGIF is to enable and empower students to take an active role in making UCLA a leader in sustainability. TGIF provides much needed funding for projects that reduce UCLA’s negative impact on the environment. Past projects have varied from solar panels on Ackerman to hydration stations, student events, and more.

## Student Organizations {#student-organizations}

Among the hundreds of UCLA student groups, there are over 25 dedicated to environmental issues. Some are listed here on the UCLA Sustainability website: [https://www.sustain.ucla.edu/our-initiatives/student-organizations/](https://www.sustain.ucla.edu/our-initiatives/student-organizations/) For a full list, check out the “Environmental“ category on the USAC page: [https://sa.ucla.edu/RCO/public/search](https://sa.ucla.edu/RCO/public/search).

Whether you want to garden, visit high school classrooms, run the UCLA Farmer’s Market, advocate for fossil-Free UCLA or fair-trade products, run for USAC officer positions, or just about anything else you can imagine - there is a student group out there for you. And if there isn’t one? Start one! Student groups are a great way to meet people and to get involved in activities on and off campus.

## USAC and ASUCLA {#usac-and-asucla}

Both the Undergraduate Student Association Council \(USAC\) and the Associated Students of UCLA \(ASUCLA\) have demonstrated their commitment to sustainability. USAC made sustainability a key area of concentration and has begun to promote sustainability efforts in the residence halls, as well as throughout the undergraduate student government offices. ASUCLA, the largest student-run student union in the country, agreed to develop a policy on sustainability as well as sustainability plan, all because of student efforts. To learn more about ASUCLA’s sustainability efforts visit [http://asucla.ucla.edu/about-asucla/target-zero-waste/](http://asucla.ucla.edu/about-asucla/target-zero-waste/)

# Off Campus

The City of Los Angeles is home to an almost dizzying array of environmental organizations and agencies--non-governmental organizations \(NGOs\) like Heal the Bay, the Natural Resources Defense Council \(NRDC\), Center for Biological Diversity; local, state, and Federal agencies including the City of Los Angeles and City of Santa Monica’s Office of Sustainability, the Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board, and National Park Service; as well as initiatives like the Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator \(LACI\) and private companies and consulting firms that all employ scientists, sustainability experts, and policy researchers. Below are some possible paths for getting involved with organizations beyond UCLA.

## Volunteer {#volunteer}

One of the best ways to gain invaluable experience while at the same time exploring areas of research or possible career paths that might interest you is through volunteering. A number of environmental non-profit organizations and government agencies, at the local, state, and federal level, provide opportunities for students to join in part-time roles to carry out work ranging from substantive research, to environmental restoration efforts, to assistance with educational and outreach initiatives. For more information on possible volunteer opportunities, or to connect with students and alumni that may have volunteered for organizations that interest you, please contact Noah Garrison \(ngarrison@ioes.ucla.edu\) or Royce Dieckmann \(rdieckmann@ioes.ucla.edu\).

## Internships {#internships}

Similar to volunteer opportunities, internships are valuable for students seeking experience in a specific field or type of organization, and can certainly be useful for networking purposes when seeking employment upon graduation. The goal of any internship is that the student be provided with a learning opportunity about the type of work the organization does and ideally will be involved in many aspects of the positions available at the organization. NGOs, government agencies, public utilities, private companies and corporations - students can intern almost anywhere. There are two main types of internships - paid or unpaid - and a different set of regulations that cover them.

Paid internships are the most desirable for obvious reasons. Students are employed on a temporary basis and paid for the work that they do while also learning the ropes of the organization. If you are fortunate enough to land a paid internship, there is no requirement that you must also earn college credit \(although you still can if you so desire\).

Unpaid internships are again subdivided due to California labor laws for the purposes of the logistics you may encounter. If you intern at a for-profit organization, you will need to earn college credit for the internship. We make that easy with our Environment 195 Internship course, and there are other ways to also earn credit for an internship at UCLA, detailed below. If you intern at a non-profit or government agency, it is not strictly speaking required that you earn credit, although many such organizations prefer that you do.

Most UCLA departments offer a course that can provide internship credit, usually 2 or 4 units depending on how many hours per week a student works at the internship. There is also an office on campus, called the Center for Community Learning, that will help arrange the course credit and manage the student’s experience, if that is desired.

For internships with an environmental or sustainability aspect we recommend that students enroll through our **Environment 195 Internship course** for credit. We will assist you in finding a faculty member to oversee the internship course and assist you with enrolling. However, some faculty may prefer that students enroll in the course through the faculty member’s home department. In these cases the process of filling out the contract is the same but the completed contract will be taken to that department’s SAO for approval and enrollment.

Summer internships can create a small complication. During the academic year \(fall/winter/spring\), because fees are on a flat basis, there is no additional charge for enrolling in an internship course. However, many students find summer internships. In these cases, the per-unit summer fee basis is used to charge the student for the internship course. This is a University policy, and one that the department is not fond of. In these cases, sometimes the employer might cover the fee, but often not. If you find that this expense creates difficulty for you, please consult with Royce Dieckmann as there is sometimes a loophole that we can use that might save you considerable expense.

**How to find an internship**

Internship in the environmental sector opportunities come up frequently and will be posted to the IoES Undergraduate message board through the [IoES Undergraduate Advising](https://piazza.com/ucla/other/ioesundergraduateadvising) board hosted by Piazza. Associated departments, such as your minor/concentration department, will also send out notices about internship opportunities. In addition, opportunities are often posted on [BruinView](https://secure.career.ucla.edu/BruinViewLogin/Login.aspx). However, the best way to find an internship in line with your interests and goals is to identify organizations for whom you would like to work, research their opportunities, and send a resume and statement of interest to their HR department or other appropriate contact. Also, many IoES faculty and staff have connections to various groups and agencies, so ask us. We may be be able to help introduce you.

# Environmental Science Official Catalog Description

**Undergraduate Study**

The Environmental Science major is a designated capstone major. In collaboration with a local agency or nonprofit institution, students work individually and in groups to complete projects that require them to integrate many of the skills, principles, theories, and concepts they have learned throughout the curriculum and apply them to real systems. Students are expected to contribute meaningfully to the analysis and solution of particular environmental science issues involving multiple disciplines and stakeholders with different perspectives. Those completing the major should possess critical thinking skills, problem-solving abilities, and familiarity with essential computational, data collection, and analysis skills, as well as demonstrate effective oral and written communication skills. Graduates should also be able to identify key ethical issues and analyze the consequences of various professional dilemmas, as well as work productively as part of a team.

**Environmental Science BS**

**Capstone Major**

The Environmental Science BS program represents strong collaboration between the Institute of the Environment and Sustainability and the Departments of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences; Civil and Environmental Engineering; Earth, Planetary, and Space Sciences; Ecology and Evolutionary Biology; Environmental Health Sciences; and Geography. The program is designed for students who are deeply interested in the study of environmental science. There are two components to the program, and both must be completed to receive the degree. The first component, the Environmental Science major, requires completion of lower-division requirements grounded in basic natural sciences, a six-course upper-division environmental science requirement reflecting the disciplinary breadth of environmental science, two social sciences/humanities courses, participation in an ongoing environmental science colloquium, and completion of an environmental science practicum. The second component is a minor or concentration in one of seven environmental science areas, each associated with a particular department. With assistance from IoES staff, students must formally apply to and be accepted by the associated department to receive the minor.

# Environmental Science Official Catalog Description

**Undergraduate Study**

The Environmental Science major is a designated capstone major. In collaboration with a local agency or nonprofit institution, students work individually and in groups to complete projects that require them to integrate many of the skills, principles, theories, and concepts they have learned throughout the curriculum and apply them to real systems. Students are expected to contribute meaningfully to the analysis and solution of particular environmental science issues involving multiple disciplines and stakeholders with different perspectives. Those completing the major should possess critical thinking skills, problem-solving abilities, and familiarity with essential computational, data collection, and analysis skills, as well as demonstrate effective oral and written communication skills. Graduates should also be able to identify key ethical issues and analyze the consequences of various professional dilemmas, as well as work productively as part of a team.

**Environmental Science BS**

**Capstone Major**

The Environmental Science BS program represents strong collaboration between the Institute of the Environment and Sustainability and the Departments of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences; Civil and Environmental Engineering; Earth, Planetary, and Space Sciences; Ecology and Evolutionary Biology; Environmental Health Sciences; and Geography. The program is designed for students who are deeply interested in the study of environmental science. There are two components to the program, and both must be completed to receive the degree. The first component, the Environmental Science major, requires completion of lower-division requirements grounded in basic natural sciences, a six-course upper-division environmental science requirement reflecting the disciplinary breadth of environmental science, two social sciences/humanities courses, participation in an ongoing environmental science colloquium, and completion of an environmental science practicum. The second component is a minor or concentration in one of seven environmental science areas, each associated with a particular department. With assistance from IoES staff, students must formally apply to and be accepted by the associated department to receive the minor.

The honors program provides exceptional students an opportunity for advanced research and study, under the guidance of a faculty member, that leads to the completion of an honors thesis or research project. To qualify for graduation with honors, students must \(1\) complete all requirements for the major, \(2\) have a cumulative grade-point average of 3.5 or better in upper-division coursework in the major and an overall GPA of 3.0 or better, \(3\) complete at least 8 units of Environment 198 taken over at least two terms, and \(4\) produce a completed satisfactory honors thesis. The honors thesis or research project is in addition to the requirement of the completed practicum in environmental science project. Contact the student affairs officer for further information.

## Guidelines for Environmental Science Departmental Honors Program {#guidelines-for-environmental-science-departmental-honors-program}

I. REQUIREMENTS FOR ELIGIBILITY

A. Junior class standing \(≥ 90 completed units of university-level course work – do not consider AP or IB units when calculating\)

B. Cumulative GPA of ≥ 3.0 in all university-level course work \(including courses required as preparation for the major\)

C. Cumulative GPA of ≥ 3.5 in course work required in the major \(excluding courses required as preparation for the major\)

D. At the discretion of the Environmental Science Program, prior completion of one or more specified courses

NOTE: The above are the minimum GPA requirements to earn Departmental Honors at graduation. Students who have a realistic chance of attaining the GPA minimums by their Degree Expected Term but who do not yet qualify at the time of application may be allowed, upon review and approval by the IoES Honors Committee, to pursue Departmental Honors.

II. REQUIREMENTS FOR ADMISSION

A. Selection and agreement of a faculty sponsor \(generally a participating faculty member in the Institute of the Environment and Sustainability who should also be a member of the UCLA Academic Senate. If a non-Academic Senate is the primary advisor, a Senate member should act as a secondary sponsor and co-signer.\)

B. Selection of a suitable thesis topic.

C. Completion and submission to the Environmental Science Honors Committee of a complete application form, Degree Progress Report, and Prospectus \(see Application and Prospectus Guidelines below\)

III. ENROLLMENT IN DEPARTMENTAL HONORS PROGRAM

All Departmental Honors students are required to enroll in two to three quarters of Environment 198 for a total of 8 units. Students wishing to pursue Departmental Honors must also complete the Senior Practicum \(180ABC\) series; Departmental Honors cannot substitute for the Senior Practicum, nor can it be used as a substitute for any other major or minor/concentration requirement.

IV. REQUIREMENTS FOR CONTINUATION \(“MINIMUM PROGRESS”\)

A. Acceptable progress towards completion of required Environmental Science Honors course work, monitored quarterly by the faculty sponsor

B. Acceptable progress towards completion of an Environmental Science Honors Thesis, monitored quarterly or more frequently by the faculty sponsor

C. At the discretion of the Environmental Science Program, participation of the student in additional “enrichment experiences,” monitored quarterly by the faculty sponsor

V. REQUIREMENTS FOR GRADUATION WITH DEPARTMENTAL “HONORS” OR “HIGHEST HONORS”

A. Completion of all requirements for the major

B. Cumulative GPA of ≥ 3.0 in all university-level course work

C. Cumulative GPA of ≥ 3.5 in upper division course work in the Major

D. Completion of required Honors course work \(Environment 198\)

E. Completion and acceptance by the Environmental Science Honors Committee of the Honors Thesis.

Application and Prospectus Guidelines

1. The prospectus should be 2-3 pages with references, and include the following components:
   1. Background: What is the motivation and context for the thesis topic? Place the problem in its broader scientific, environmental, and policy \(if applicable\) context, and include a summary of what is known about the problem already.
   2. Explain who the audience is: Who will find this thesis topic important? What agency or group would be interested in the results?
   3. Clearly state your objectives. What question are you asking?
   4. Include a clear timeline showing the steps you will take to complete the thesis and your approximate time of completion for each. A condensed version of this timeline should be provided on the contract you submit to your advisor.
   5. Specifics regarding the thesis: What kind of data are you collecting? What methods are you using? Where will the research take place \(e.g. field site\)? What type of analysis will you be using? What are your expected results?
   6. A brief summary of the support you have or will need to carry out the thesis work. This includes who your advisor is, and your access to the tools you need to get your thesis done.
   7. References
2. The thesis must have some depth and measure of completion. Merely assisting on projects in a lab or a research group will not suffice. We expect products \(below\) focused on one topic.
3. Progress Report: Students must submit a progress report at the end of each quarter for the duration of their enrollment in the Environment 198 Honors Program. This can focus on skills learned and measurements made, as well as preliminary results and if necessary, changes in your research plan. This is a formal requirement, and should be 2-3 pages submitted to the IoES and to your advisor.
4. In order for the honors thesis to be accepted for satisfaction of the Environmental Science Departmental Honors Program, it will need to satisfy the following criteria:
   1. You must submit an acceptable written final thesis paper that describes the results of independent research based on an investigation of the literature about the topic, fieldwork, or lab results and data. The thesis should be approximately 20 to 30 pages, but remember, quantity is not a substitute for quality. You must also make an acceptable oral presentation of your results. The thesis paper and presentation should be complete, and include a motivation and background section that covers its broader context, methods, results, conclusions, and suggestions for further work. The work should be placed in a broader context that includes environmental impacts as well as the implications for specific policy, regulatory, economic and/or social issues where applicable.
   2. The oral presentation will normally be made before or after the presentations made by the 180B/C students, typically during the final Environmental Science Colloquium class meeting in spring quarter. It must present your thesis results delivered in a clear, well-crafted and professional manner.
   3. The prospectus and thesis should be approved by your advisor, and the thesis should be accompanied by a short statement from your advisor stating the final grade for the project and his or her recommendation for level of honors. It is critical that your advisor understand the commitment they are making to you and your project; the Honors project goes well beyond the expectations of a normal 199 independent study.
   4. The Environmental Science Faculty Advisory Committee will determine, with consideration of the advising faculty member’s recommendation, the level of Honors to be granted. If for some reason you are unable to complete the thesis or satisfy these criteria, you will still earn the units and the grades for completion of Environment 198 courses, but no other credit will be given.

Deadlines and important information for pursuing the Environmental Science Honors Program:

* Application and Prospectus Deadline:

You must submit the attached application and a satisfactory prospectus \(proposal of your thesis topic\) to the IoES Honors Faculty Committee and to your proposed advisor no later than two weeks before the end of the term prior to the term in which you will enroll for the first time in Environment 198. It is generally advisable to begin the project during fall or winter quarter, but students starting in spring can complete it if enrolled in Environment 198 during summer or the subsequent fall, if eligible to continue at UCLA. Submit these materials, via email attachments, to rdieckmann@ioes.ucla.edu.

* Contract Course Deadline: Friday of week two \(fall, winter & spring\)

Upon acceptance to the Environmental Science Departmental Honors Program, you will need to submit a copy of the Environment 198 enrollment contract signed by your project advisor at the beginning \(or earlier\) of each quarter for which you will enroll in Environment 198. The strict deadline for contract course enrollment is before the end of week 2 of each quarter in which you will enroll. You will create the Environment 198 course on your MyUCLA site, by clicking on “contract courses” and following the step-by-step instructions found there. The 198 course is variable units per quarter, with a mandatory grade basis \(not P/NP\). You will need to submit a course contract to enroll in the 198 units for each quarter prior to completing the project. Bring the contract in person to the IoES SAO \(Royce Dieckmann\) in Life Science 2308.

* PRACTICUM VS. HONORS: An independent practicum project is NOT a departmental honors project. The two are separate, and completing the Departmental Honors Program does not exempt one from, or substitute for, the Senior Practicum.
* ALTERNATIVES: Any student contemplating pursuing the Honors Program with faculty outside of UCLA or that will take place at another institution must consult with and gain the prior written approval of the IoES Faculty Honors Committee prior to undertaking any such project.

# Practicum substitution requests guidelines

**Students wishing to pursue an independent research project in lieu of participating on a Practicum team should contact the IoES Practicum Director, Noah Garrison at **[ngarrison@ioes.ucla.edu](mailto:ngarrison@ioes.ucla.edu)

1. Students wishing to pursue an independent project for the practicum must enroll in Environment 180A in fall quarter of the academic year in which you will graduate. There is no substitute available for 180A. This is a stand-alone course that provides a variety of important skills that are not provided elsewhere.
2. You must be in good academic standing, and have a minimum GPA of 3.0 or better in the major.
3. You must submit a satisfactory prospectus \(proposal of your project\) to the IoES faculty committee and to your proposed advisor by \[date varies based on date group projects will be assigned\]. The prospectus should be 2-3 pages with references, and include the following components:
   1. Background: What is the motivation and context for the project? Place the problem in its broader scientific, environmental, and policy \(if applicable\) context, and include a summary of what is known about the problem already.
   2. Explain who the audience is: Who will find this project important? What agency or group would be interested in the project results?
   3. Clearly state your objectives. What question are you asking?
   4. Include a clear timeline showing the steps you will take to complete the project and your approximate time of completion for each. A condensed version of this timeline should be provided on the contract you submit to your advisor.
   5. Specifics regarding the project: What kind of data are you collecting? What methods are you using? Where will the research take place \(e.g. field site\)? What type of analysis will you be using? What are your expected results?
   6. A brief summary of the support you have or will need to carry out the project. This includes who your advisor is, and your access to the tools you need to get your project done.
   7. References
4. The project must have some depth and measure of completion. Merely assisting on projects in a lab or similar will not suffice, and although you can help with more than one project, we expect products \(below\) focused on one project.
5. Progress Report: For projects lasting longer than one quarter \(the most common situation\), you will need to submit a progress report before the end of the first quarter. This can focus on skills learned and measurements made, as well as preliminary results and if necessary, changes in your research plan. This is a formal requirement, and should be 2-3 pages submitted to the department and to your advisor. Students who fail to submit an acceptable progress report will not be permitted to enroll in the second term of Environment 199 until the progress report has been submitted.
6. In order for the project to be accepted as a substitution for Environment 180B and C to fulfill the Practicum component of the Environmental Science major, it will need to satisfy the following criteria:
   1. You must submit an acceptable written final project report, and make an acceptable oral presentation of your results. The paper and presentation should be complete, and include a motivation and background section that covers its broader context, methods, results, conclusions, and suggestions for further work. The work should be placed in a broader context that includes environmental impacts as well as the implications for specific policy, regulatory, economic and/or social issues where applicable.
   2. The oral presentation will normally be made before or after the presentations made by the 180B/C students, typically during the final Environmental Science Colloquium class meeting in spring quarter. It must be a scientific presentation of your project results delivered in a clear, well crafted and professional manner that is on time \(does not go over the allotted time limit, and uses at least 90% of the allotted time\). If your presentation does not pass, you will have one more chance to make an oral presentation in front of one or more appropriate faculty.
   3. The prospectus and final paper should be approved by your advisor, and the final paper should be accompanied by a short statement from your advisor certifying that you performed work at least equivalent to 10 units of independent research. It is critical that your advisor read and understand the commitment they are making to you and your project; the practicum project goes well beyond the expectations of a normal 199 independent study.
   4. The Environmental Science Faculty Advisory Committee will determine whether the final project is a satisfactory substitution for the Practicum. If for some reason you are unable to complete the project and satisfy these criteria for course substitution, you may still be eligible to apply the unit credit towards upper division credit for your major by petition.

Deadlines and important information for pursuing an independent project for the Practicum:

**Prospectus Deadline**:

You will need to have your prospectus document completed by \[the week that group projects are assigned\]. The deadline to submit a final, polished prospectus to the faculty committee of the IoES will be the end of \[the week that group projects are assigned\] and you must secure a faculty advisor by that time. This is accomplished much more easily with a strong prospectus. Email a copy to rdieckmann@ioe.ucla.edu to distribute to the faculty committee.

**Contract Course Deadline**: Friday of week two \(winter & spring\)

You will need to submit a signed copy of the following contract with your project advisor at the beginning of winter quarter or earlier, along with your course enrollment contract, before the end of week 2 of winter quarter to the IoES SAO \(Royce\) in Life Science 2308. You will create the Environment 199 course on your MyUCLA site, by choosing the link for “contract courses” and following the step-by-step instructions found there. The 199 is 4 units per quarter, with a mandatory grade basis \(not P/NP\). You will need to also submit a course contract to enroll in the 199 units for spring quarter.

* **Honors**: An independent practicum project is NOT a departmental honors project. However, if you are enrolled with College Honors, the 180A/B/C courses already automatically grant units with College Honors. Students who qualify to apply for the Departmental Honors Program will be contacted with guidelines and instructions for applying to that program.
* **Alternatives**: Students interested in the Field Biology Quarter or the Marine Biology Quarter should consult with Royce Dieckmann, SAO in the IoES, prior to the deadline for independent project prospectuses, and with the counselors in the Ecology & Evolutionary Biology department regarding availability and admission to those programs. Any student contemplating a project with faculty outside of UCLA or that will take place at another institution must consult with the IoES prior to undertaking any such project and before the week 4 deadline for independent project prospectus.

Students whose proposals are rejected by the IoES faculty committee will be placed with 180B/C groups.
