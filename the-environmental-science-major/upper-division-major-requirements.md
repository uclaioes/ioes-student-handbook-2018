# Upper-Division Major Requirements

Course requirements of the major are structured to provide intellectual breadth and introduce students to the key fields that exist under the umbrella of environmental science, and to provide course options from multiple departments to expose
students to different disciplinary approaches.

We recommend that students use the major requirements to explore the various fields and disciplines available to them before choosing a concentration. Students are encouraged to take courses of greatest personal interest to them as early as possible.

The upper-division major requirements are divided into four sections:

Physical and Life Sciences (5 courses) 
Social Science and Humanities (3 courses)
Sustainability Talks (2 units)
Practicum (3 courses)

All upper-division courses in the Environmental Science major must be taken for a letter grade with the exception of the Sustainability Talks, which are P/NP graded. Students must earn a C average (2.0) or above in the upper-division requirements to graduate. 

The first two sections are composed primarily of lecture-style courses, although there are also lab and field courses amongst these. Students are required to take 8 courses across these two sections. Details and course descriptions are listed below.

Students are required to take two Sustainability Talks units from a set of course options that are designed to bring students in the major together and expose them to the myriad of possibilities for careers, research, engagement and involvement with environmental matters of all types through a lecture series. These courses are one unit, P/NP graded and consist of a guest lecture each week.

The Senior Practicum is a year-long series that is the capstone to the major. The three courses are taken over fall, winter and spring quarters in the student’s final year.

Note: Students do not need to complete the entirety of their prep courses prior to beginning upper-division major requirements. However, courses may have prerequisites or recommended requisites that students should complete or consider before enrolling.


## Course Options {#course-options}

### Multiple Listed Courses {#multiple-listed-courses}

Courses where the course number is preceded by an “M” are mutliple-listed between more than one department. The course description notes which department and course number where the other offering\(s\) of the course may be found. Students may enroll in the course under any of the departments offering it and will receive the same credit.

### Substitutions and Petitions {#substitutions-and-petitions}

Students wishing to substitute a course, either one found at UCLA or from another institution, can submit a petition to IoES for consideration. It is best if this is done in advance on an advisory basis. Simply send an email to the IoES SAO with your request in the following format:

_Subject line: Petition for \[category\]_

_I would like to use \[course\] from \[institution\] to be taken in \[term/year\] for the \[category requirement\]._

Attach a syllabus if available, or include a course description or links to course information. The more information you can provide about the course the easier it is for a determination to be made.

### Program Plan {#program-plan}

The most up-to-date version of the program plan is always available on the IoES website in the Current Students - Resources section: [https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/envisci/resources/](https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/envisci/resources/)

## Physical and Life Science Requirements \(20-22 units\) {#science-requirements-24-26-units}

All students will take Environment 175 (recommended for 3rd year) and 4 additional electives from the course options. No more than two courses can be from any one department. For multiple-listed courses, department is determined by how it is listed in the plan, not by the department under which the student enrolls.

## The Colloquium Requirement \(4 units\) {#the-colloquium-requirement-4-units}

Choose from Environment 170, 185A, 193, and some 188B seminars

The Colloquium requirement is a low-impact set of lecture courses designed to bring students in the major and minor together and to introduce students to the myriad possibilities available in the environmental sciences through guest lectures by distinguished speakers from outside the university in a variety of fields, as well as by UCLA faculty and researchers.

Any of the above courses can be taken at any time they are offered, taken at any stage of the major, and repeated for credit. There is no required order in which to take the courses.

Environment 185A is offered every fall quarter.

Environment 170 is offered every winter and spring quarter.

Environment 193 is usually offered in spring quarter.

Environment 188B is a variable topics course.

Regarding 188B: When a special seminar is offered that is acceptable for this requirement, it will be advertised by the department through the Piazza email list. The version of 188B that is listed each quarter for the Sustainable LA Grand Challenges Research Scholars Program is not acceptable for the Colloquium requirement.
