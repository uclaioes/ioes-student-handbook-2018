# Senior Practicum

## Overview {#overview}

The three-quarter Practicum in Environmental Science is the capstone educational experience required of all environmental science majors and represents a significant departure from conventional teaching and learning experiences at UCLA.

Designed to launch our students into impactful careers in the environment, the Practicum pairs teams of five to seven seniors with a faculty member or other environmental expert. Then it immerses them in an independent, original, environmental or sustainability research project for prominent clients from outside the university, ranging from The Nature Conservancy and Natural Resources Defense Council, to Northrop Grumman or the National Park Service.** **Clients often return to participate year after year. In addition to providing an unprecedented opportunity for our majors to produce complex, professional quality work while still a student, the Practicum generates valuable information and resources for the clients’ missions.

Faculty advisors attend regular weekly meetings with their teams and may help teams arrange travel and interactions with clients or other experts in the field, as well as offer advice to guide the scope of projects. However, advisors _do not serve as project managers_; their role is more of a mentor and coach—projects do not come with step by step directions! Project leadership and management, and the quality of the final products prepared for clients, are the responsibility of the students on each team. To meet their project’s goals, students will spend part of the year developing professional work habits and skills, which will prepare them for a successful transition to careers in environmental science. Indeed, alumni often say that the Practicum experience is what gave them the edge in getting jobs or into graduate programs.

## 180A: Fall Quarter {#180a-fall-quarter}

## Lectures, Labs, Assigning Teams, and Literature Reviews {#lectures-labs-assigning-teams-and-literature-reviews}

In the first quarter of the capstone sequence, students attend lectures and presentations designed to introduce them to some of the common tools and methodologies of environmental problem solving, building on what they have been exposed to in other courses. Students become familiar with the norms and ethical and policy issues that occur in the professional practice of environmental science, and examine how scientific data and research are used to make decisions in policy, professional, regulatory and other arenas. Students are introduced to their clients and the environmental science and policy questions they will take on in their group projects in ENV 180B and 180C during the winter and spring. Based on their individual preferences and backgrounds, students are assigned to a Practicum project team roughly half way through the quarter.

Course work for the 180A class includes two major components:

* A lab based introduction to data handling, basic statistics and data exploration, and spatial analysis using Geographic Information Systems \(GIS\). Labs, which focus on the application of these tools to environmental problem solving, meet once per week, but students should expect to spend 6-8 hours per week outside of scheduled lab time completing assignments.
* The literature review – after being assigned to a Practicum project, students conduct independent literature reviews of recent scientific and policy research on a specific aspect of their project topic. Students effectively ask the question “what do we know, or not know about a particular issue?” This differs from most research papers or essays students have written in previous classes; the literature review does not involve developing and supporting a thesis. Instead, students conduct a critical analysis on the current state of research, including reviewing any gaps in knowledge and problems with research methodologies, or any controversies or major disagreements in the field, to prepare themselves for tackling their Practicum project in 180B/C.

## 180B/C: Winter and Spring Quarters {#180b-c-winter-and-spring-quarters}

## Proposals, Research, Presentations, Final Reports {#proposals-research-presentations-final-reports}

During winter and spring, students work as a team on their client-based environmental projects, diving into real-life application of multi-disciplinary problem solving. Project work includes formulation of a formal research proposal providing detail on how the team will meet the project’s goals, conducting research, and development of presentations and a final report and other work product that will be defined in collaboration with the client. Depending on the nature of the project, work may include field work or reconnaissance, including travel outside of the Los Angeles area, original data collection and analysis, close collaboration with your client and other experts and stakeholders in the field, and learning any number of skills or analytical approaches necessary to complete the project. In some cases, a team’s final research report may provide the basis for a publication in a peer-reviewed journal. In this case, the advisor and client will work with the students after graduation to edit for possible publication.

### Working and managing in a team {#working-and-managing-in-a-team}

Students will be faced with needing to conduct and coordinate work, by multiple team members, on multiple tracks at once, and over a limited timeframe. This is similar to situations encountered in the professional world, where preliminary research may be conducted while efforts to finalize a project framework or proposal are still being completed. In broad terms, it will be important for the success of each project that:

* Students operate independently as a professional team;
* All parties develop a high level of trust and spirit of collaboration;
* Students and faculty are responsive to clients while conducting independent research;
* Communication among team members and between parties is professional and frequent; and
* Possibly most importantly, students feel comfortable to make decisions, make mistakes, and learn from the experience.

Students should expect to devote 12-15 hours a week, on average, to their group project, although more hours in any specific week can be expected depending on the particular needs of each project. This time includes class meeting time and field trips as appropriate for each project. Importantly, to avoid excess workload during spring quarter, each team will need to ensure that progress on their group projects is evenly allocated over the two quarters.

## Substitutions for the Practicum {#substitutions-for-the-practicum}

While the capstone Practicum sequence is the expected path for all environmental science majors, we recognize there may be circumstances that require a student to substitute other coursework or research in lieu of completing part or all of the Practicum program. Any substitution will require a petition to the IoES Academic Committee, and will be evaluated on an individual basis. Please see below for an overview of general IoES policy regarding potential substitutions.

* In order to substitute any portion of the Practicum, students must be in good academic standing and maintain at least a 3.0 GPA in the major.
* All students are expected to complete 180A, the fall Practicum class and associated GIS labs. Students may petition to substitute an independent study course for 180A where the student 1\) plans to substitute coursework or independent research for the 180B/C sequence in place of a Practicum project, and 2\) the student has completed at least an approved introductory GIS course. In this case, and upon an approved petition, the student will be required to complete a literature review paper for credit as independent study. All students who have not previously completed an approved GIS course, however, should plan to enroll in 180A.
* Students may petition to substitute a variety of potential field courses or independent research projects in place of 180B/C and completion of a Practicum project. Programs that have previously been approved for substitution include:
  * Participation in the Marine Biology Quarter \(MBQ\) or Field Biology Quarter \(FBQ\) programs through the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology.
  * Completion of the UC Natural Reserve System field course \(taken in any term, including summer\).
