# Declaring the Major

For students who enter UCLA as freshmen, declaring the Environmental Science major is usually a relatively simple matter.

If already enrolled in another major within the College of Letters and Science, there is no need to inform the current major department of the change of major. However, if enrolled in a major in any other college or school at UCLA, such as Engineering or Arts, the process is more involved.

## Major Declaration in the College of Letters and Science {#major-declaration-in-the-college-of-letters-and-science}

The requirements for a student to change their major to Environmental Science are as follows:

If within the first two years of study, the student must:

* Be in good academic standing \(not on academic probation or subject to dismissal\)
* Be making progress in the preparatory courses
* Be able to complete all remaining program requirements within the unit maximum of 216 \(including GE/College requirements, major, and minor/concentration requirements, as well as any other program such as additional minors or majors\)
* Not have 2 or more preparatory courses with grades below C-, or an overall GPA in the major preparatory courses below 2.0.

If the above conditions are met the student can in most cases declare the major by making an appointment with the SAO.

If in the third year of study \(immediately following spring quarter of the second year\) or if any of the above conditions are not met, the student will need to consult with the department SAO about what steps must be taken to qualify to declare the major. It may be a simple matter of catching up with some coursework or preparing a viable academic plan. In other cases, a petition may need to be filed with the department asking for an exception to a department regulation, or a petition may be required by the College, such as in cases where a student will exceed the unit maximum or time to degree.

## Major Declaration from another School at UCLA {#major-declaration-from-another-school-at-ucla}

In addition to meeting the bulleted requirements above, for a student to change their major to Environmental Science while enrolled in another school, such as Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science \(HSSEAS\), Arts & Architecture, Music, or Theater Film & Television, requires that the student first obtain a change of program form and degree planner from the College Academic Counseling office at Murphy Hall, Room A316. The Environmental Science counselor will help prepare and review the plan, and if acceptable will sign it indicating departmental approval. The petition will then be returned to the College, which makes the determination whether the student will be permitted to transfer to the College and into the Environmental Science major.

## Readmission {#readmission}

Students who have completed readmission coursework and wish to change majors to Environmental Science are always reviewed on a case-by-case basis. In most cases the bulleted requirements above must be met and if in violation of departmental regulations a petition must be filed and approved by the department in advance of any petition to the College. Students seeking readmission with the Environmental Science major should make an appointment with the IoES SAO, Royce Dieckmann, to determine eligibility to enter the major.

## Dismissal and Minimum Standards {#dismissal-and-minimum-standards}

A student may be dismissed from the major, be denied permission to enter the major, or may be denied his or her degree, depending on which of the conditions below have been violated.

1. Earns grades below C- in two or more of the major preparatory courses
2. Earns a GPA below 2.0 in the preparatory courses
3. Earns a grade below C in Environment 180A
4. Earns below a 2.0 GPA in the major overall, and in the upper-division requirements for the major

A student in violation of rules 1, 2, and 3 can petition the IoES Undergraduate Academic Committee for an exception, which is reviewed on a case-by-case basis. If rule 4 is violated, the student must petition the College for an exception to graduate or must make up the courses necessary to bring their GPA over 2.0. In any of the above cases, consult with the IoES SAO.
