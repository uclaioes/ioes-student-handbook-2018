# The Preparatory Courses

The preparatory courses for the Environmental Science major are typical for any bachelor’s of science program. The major requires 13 total prep courses. We recommend that students entering UCLA as freshmen take two prep courses each quarter until all 13 are completed, which will satisfy all of the prep requirements by the end of the second year of study.

## Introduction to Environmental Science {#introduction-to-environmental-science}

_Required:_ Environment M10 _or_ Earth Planetary and Space Sciences 1.

Students may choose between Environment M10 – Introduction to Environmental Science, or Earth, Planetary, and Space Sciences 1 – Introduction to Earth Science. We strongly urge students to complete this requirement in the first or second year of study, or as soon as possible during junior year for transfer students.

For the majority of students, we recommend Environment M10. M10 covers earth science, atmospheric science, oceanography, and some conservation, policy, and other environmental issues. It is usually offered only in fall quarter. However, students who complete the GE Cluster M1 series \(Food: Lens for Environment and Sustainability\) may find the course slightly redundant, and for those students or for those with a strong interest in the Earth Sciences, the EPSS 1 course, which focuses more on geology and oceanography, may be a suitable alternate.

### AP Credit {#ap-credit}

No AP credit equivalent to either course.

### Introduction to Environmental Science Course Descriptions {#introduction-to-environmental-science-course-descriptions}

_**Environment M10. Introduction to Environmental Science**_**.** \(4\) \(Same as Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences M10.\) Lecture, three hours; laboratory, one hour. Limited to undergraduate students. Introduction to environmental science as discipline and as a way of thinking. Discussion of critical environmental issues at local and global scales. Fundamentals of physical, chemical, and biological processes important to environmental science. Laboratory exercises to augment lectures. Letter grading.

_**Earth, Planetary, and Space Sciences 1. Introduction to Earth Science**. _\(5\) Lecture, three hours; laboratory, two hours; field days. Not open to students with credit for or currently enrolled in course 100 or former courses 1F and 1H. Elements of Earth science; study of Earth materials; nature and interpretation of geologic evidence; study of geologic processes; historical aspects of geology. Mandatory field trips introduce students to solving of geologic problems in field. P/NP or letter grading.

## Mathematics \(Calculus\) {#mathematics-calculus}

_Required:_ Math 31A and 31B _or_ Math 3A and 3B.

_Additional courses, depending on minor/concentration:_ Math 32A _or_ 3C.

The major requires that all students take either Math 31A and 31B or Math 3A and 3B. Math 32A or 3C is required for the Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, Environmental Engineering, and Earth and Environmental Science concentrations, and is an option for the Environmental Systems and Society and the Geography/Environmental Studies concentrations.

Math is fundamental to the study of all other science core courses; as such it is recommended that students enroll in the Math courses among the earliest prep courses taken. The two series – 31 and 3 – are similar, but students who do not feel especially strong in calculus may prefer the 3-series.

### Switching Math Series {#switching-math-series}

Students may currently move between the math series courses. For example, if a student took Math 31A, they can then enroll in Math 3B to complete the series. If the student took Math 3B, they may enroll in Math 32A. There are some disadvantages to switching series, primarily due to the order in which the material is taught, so students who switch should be prepared for additional challenge.

Note that there have been changes proposed for the Math 3ABC series that may change the ability of students to switch between series. We will make every attempt to notify students if or when these changes take effect.

### Math & Environmental Engineering {#math-environmental-engineering}

Students interested in pursuing the Environmental Engineering concentration are urged to take Math 32A rather than 3C. 32A leads to second-year calculus courses that students who may decide they wish to pursue graduate study in Environmental Engineering will need to take. Math 3C does not permit students to enroll in these second-year calculus courses.

### AP Credit {#ap-credit-0}

Students who earned a 5 score on the Calculus AB exam will have earned credit for Math 31A. Students who earned a score of 5 on the BC exam will have credit for Math 31A and 31B, while a score of 4 earns Math 31A credit.

### Life Science 30A and 30B {#life-science-30a-and-30b}

The Life Sciences Division has created an alternate math series as another option that they feel provides a mathematics background appropriate for students in the Division’s majors. These courses have not been approved for the Environmental Science major as an official component of the major. However, students who have completed these courses prior to enrolling in the ES major, or who strongly feel that these courses will be of greater benefit than the traditional calculus courses, are permitted to take these two courses in lieu of the Math series above. It is very important for students to be aware that taking the LS 30A/B courses will limit their choice of minor/concentration. Students taking LS 30A/B will not be permitted to pursue the Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, Environmental Engineering, or Earth and Environmental Science minors/concentrations \(unless the student also takes the calculus series\). Additionally, the Math Department does not allow students taking LS 30A/B to then take either Math 3C or 32A.

## Chemistry {#chemistry}

_Required_: Chemistry 14A, 14B, and 14BL _or_ 20A, 20B, and 20L

_Additional courses, depending on minor/concentration:_ Chemistry 14C _or_ 30A

Like calculus, chemistry is fundamental to environmental science and a strong science foundation for any B.S. program. As with math, we recommend that the Chemistry series be started during the first year of study. For most students in the Environmental Science major, the 14-series is recommended, primarily because it introduces organic chemistry earlier.

Chemistry is the most versatile of the prep courses in regards to the concentrations, because Chemistry 14C or 30A can be applied to any of them. It is required for Conservation Biology and Environmental Health Sciences, and an option for all others.

Students generally cannot switch Chemistry series once a course in either series has been completed. It is therefore imperative that students choose the series wisely; for most Environmental Science majors we recommend the 14-series.

### AP Credit {#ap-credit-1}

## Life Science {#life-science}

_Students admitted 16F or earlier:_

_Required_: Life Sciences 1 _and_ 2

_Additional courses, depending on minor/concentration:_ Life Sciences 3 _and_ 23L

_Students admitted 17F or after:_

_Required:_ Life Sciences 7A _and_ 7B

_Additional courses, depending on minor/concentration_: Life Science 7C _and_ 23L.

Otherwise known as “Biology,” Life Sciences at UCLA is divided in a rather unique way when compared to the offerings at many other universities. Because of this, students should consult with the IoES SAO or the Life Sciences Core Office \(lscore@lifesci.ucla.edu\) prior to enrolling in any courses at any other institution intended to substitute for the UCLA courses.

### Life Science 1 / 2 or 7A / 7B? {#life-science-1-2-or-7a-7b}

Environmental Science majors have historically been required to take Life Sciences \(LS\) 1 and 2, with students wishing to pursue the Conservation Biology or Environmental Health concentrations required to also take LS 3 and 23L. However, the Life Sciences Division recently introduced a new series that is set to replace the LS 1-4 series: the 7A/B/C series. Students who entered UCLA in fall of 2016 or earlier have the choice to complete either series. If the LS 1-2-3 series was started in the 2016-17 academic year, it should be completed by the end of the 2017-18 academic year, as this series of courses will be discontinued. Any student admitted fall 2017 or later, or any student who has not yet begun the series before fall 2017, should take the LS 7A/B/C series.

### Who takes Life Science 23L? {#who-takes-life-science-23l}

Students wishing to pursue the Conservation Biology or Environmental Health concentrations must take LS 3 and 23L or LS 7C and 23L. 23L is the lab component previously included with LS 2 and LS 3. This 2 unit lab course is best taken concurrently with LS 3 or 7C. All students wishing to take LS 3 will need to take Chem 14C or 30A since completing it is a prerequisite for enrolling in LS 3.

### AP Credit {#ap-credit-2}

We do not recognize any AP credit as equivalent to any of the Life Science series courses.

### Life Science Course Descriptions {#life-science-course-descriptions}

_**1. Evolution, Ecology, and Biodiversity.**_\(5\) Lecture, three hours; laboratory, two hours; one field trip. Introduction to principles and mechanisms of evolution by natural selection; population, behavioral, and community ecology; and biodiversity, including major taxa and their evolutionary, ecological, and physiological relationships.

## Statistics {#statistics}

_Required_: Statistics 12 _or_ 13

Statistical analysis is ubiquitous in environmental science, and as such, a course in statistics is required of all Environmental Science majors. The purpose of statistics is to design, construct, and evaluate techniques for analyzing data. The data can be qualitative or quantitative, self-reported or machine-collected, and the motivations can be scientific, commercial, legal, or policy driven.

The two recommended Statistics courses are largely similar; both will provide a background that is appropriate for the types of analysis students will undertake in the major. Statistics 12 is also a Social Analysis GE, while Statistics 13 is not a GE. On the other hand, 12 is a smaller class and is usually offered only once a year, so it is typically easier to enroll in 13.

Students who are planning to double major or take a minor that requires a different statistics course should consult with the IoES SAO prior to enrolling in any other statistics course. Usually we can accommodate such requirements as a substitution, particularly when the other department has a strict requirement, such as the Economics and Psychology departments. Transfer students who have already taken a lower-division statistics course must inform the IoES SAO so that credit can be applied. All other students must submit a substitution request to the IoES SAO prior to enrolling in any Statistics course other than 12 or 13.

### AP Credit {#ap-credit-3}

We do not recognize any AP credit as equivalent to either Statistics course or to fulfill the Statistics requirement for the major prep.

### Statistics Course Descriptions {#statistics-course-descriptions}

_**12. Introduction to Statistical Methods for Geography and Environmental Studies.**_\(5\) Lecture, four hours; discussion, one hour; laboratory, one hour. Not open for credit to students with credit for course 10, 11, or 13. Introduction to statistical thinking and understanding, with emphasis on techniques used in geography and environmental science. Underlying logic behind statistical procedures, role of variation in statistical thinking, strengths and limitations of statistical summaries, and fundamental inferential tools. Emphasis on applications in geography and environmental science in laboratory work using professional statistical analysis package, including spatial statistics. P/NP or letter grading.

_**13. Introduction to Statistical Methods for Life and Health Sciences.**_** **\(5\) Lecture, three hours; discussion, one hour; laboratory, one hour. Not open for credit to students with credit for course 10, 10H, 11, 12, or 14. Presentation and interpretation of data, descriptive statistics, introduction to correlation and regression and to basic statistical inference \(estimation, testing of means and proportions, ANOVA\) using both bootstrap methods and parametric models. P/NP or letter grading.

## Physics {#physics}

Students admitted 16F or earlier:

_Required:_ Physics 6A _and_ 6B, _or_ Physics 1A _and_ 1B

_Additional courses, depending on minor/concentration_: Physics 6C _or_ 1C

Students admitted 17F or later:

_Required:_ Physics 5A _and_ 5C, _or_ Physics 1A _and_ 1B

_Additional courses, depending on minor/concentration_: Physics 5B _or_ 1C

Physics is the study of the forces and laws of nature, from the largest galaxies to the tiniest subatomic particles. It's the most fundamental science, since the laws of nature determine everything else, forming the basis of chemistry and ultimately of biology, organisms, and ecosystems. It also encompasses electricity and magnetism. Advances in these and other areas of physics have made electric power, industry, electronic devices, and our modern standard of living possible.

Students earn their foundation in Physics through the pursuit of one of the course series options. As with Life Sciences, one of these options has recently changed.

### Physics 6A/B/C or 5A/C/B? {#physics-6a-b-c-or-5a-c-b}

Prior to fall 2017, the Life Sciences Physics series was the 6A/B/C series. This series has been reorganized and renumbered starting in fall 2017 as the 5A/B/C series. Students who began the 6-series prior to 17F are encouraged to complete the required courses in the 17-18 academic year, as the series will be discontinued. Students who have not yet started the series should take the 5 series.

For most students in the Environmental Science major, we recommend the 5 \(formerly 6-\) series of Physics. It provides more context and connection for the biological sciences than the 1-series. For students pursuing the Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences or Earth and Environmental Science minor/concentration, the third-quarter Physics course is recommended as additional preparation for the minor. It is especially useful for Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences for the introduction to thermodynamics, which will be important in many upper-division Atmospheric and Oceanic Science courses.

While it is possible to switch between Physics series, it is not recommended.

### AP Credit {#ap-credit-4}

We do not recognize any AP credit as equivalent to any course in the Physics series.
