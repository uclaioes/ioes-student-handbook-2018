# About The Major

The bachelor’s degree in environmental science is an immersive, multifaceted, educational experience. Drawing on the resources of a diverse, world-class university in UCLA, it emphasizes real-world practice—getting students off campus to solve problems with companies, organizations and communities. Along the way, students create their experience, using the campus, city and vast natural areas of California as living laboratories. After they graduate, 80 percent of our students go on to work in environmental professions, while others use what they’ve learned to pursue careers in social science, business, the arts, and more.

The classroom portion of the degree is rooted in physical and life sciences, including foundational courses in chemistry, biology, mathematics, and physics. And because environmental issues are human issues, all students also take multiple classes in social sciences and humanities—learning subjects such as public policy, politics, journalism, and environmental justice. To make this happen, IoES partners with departments across campus. Students are also offered unparalleled opportunities to engage with global experts who visit UCLA and observe cutting-edge research at lectures and symposiums, or to potentially participate in that research with IoES and partner faculty. This broad education prepares our students to take on the complex, pressing environmental issues the world faces.

## [Interdisciplinary Major](#interdisciplinary-major)

The study and practice of environmental science are by nature interdisciplinary pursuits, and the B.S. program draws on strong connections across numerous departments at UCLA that all touch on the environmental science field. At their core, environmental issues are human issues. Rooted in life and physical sciences, our curriculum also features multiple classes in social sciences and humanities—subjects such as public policy, politics, journalism, and environmental justice. This gives students a broad perspective and tools to take on today’s most complex, urgent environmental challenges. Students will take upper division courses in areas covering the physical and life sciences from departments around campus such as:

- Atmospheric and Oceanic Science
- Geography
- Earth Planetary and Space Sciences
- Ecology and Evolutionary Biology
- Civil and Environmental Engineering
- Environmental Health Sciences

And others…

In addition, students will take courses on the politics and policy of environmental issues, and on anthropogenic forces or human interactions with the environment, primarily through courses offered by the IoES but also from Geography, Public Policy, Urban Planning, English, Philosophy, and others.

Students also participate in a 1-unit Sustainability Talks series that brings faculty from within the UCLA community and experts from outside organizations and government agencies to present on topics relevant to sustainability and environmental science.

## [Minors](#minors)

Environmental science students play a large role in directing their own education. In addition to taking upper division classes across a variety of environmental disciplines, students choose one of seven minors/concentrations, which are indicated on their diplomas, to develop a deep expertise:

* Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences
* Conservation Biology
* Environmental Engineering
* Environmental Health
* Environmental Systems and Society
* Geography/Environmental Studies
* Earth and Environmental Science

## [Senior Practicum](#senior-practicum)

Our students learn by doing, getting off-campus to solve problems over a full year with the one-of-a-kind Senior Practicum. This capstone experience is like no other, bonding students, faculty and professionals as they work in small teams to solve real-world problems. Recent practicum teams have worked to:

* Develop sustainable aquaculture models, with The Nature Conservancy
* Assess health and community Impacts of urban oil drilling in south Los Angeles, with STAND-LA
* Draft plans to connect fragmented habitat threatened by climate change in and around Sequoia National Park, with the U.S. National Park Service
* Develop a model and economic blueprint for sustainable ebony production in central Africa, with Taylor Guitars and Madinter
