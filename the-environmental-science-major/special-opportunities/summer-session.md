# Summer Session

Summer session is a great way to get ahead, catch up, or help manage your schedule by taking courses at UCLA or elsewhere.

## [Summer at UCLA](#summer-at-ucla)

UCLA offers two sessions each summer, A and C session, which run from mid-June through July, and August through mid-September, respectively. Each 6-week session offers a variety of courses, including some that are tough to enroll in during the academic year but are easy to get into in the summer. All units, grades, and course credit automatically applies to your program, so there’s no hassle with sending transcripts or finding compatible equivalent courses, and you can be assured you’ll get the quality instruction you’ve come to expect at UCLA.

The official UCLA Summer Sessions schedule is on-line in January and registration for UCLA students begins in February. Two courses in a session is considered a full-time load due to the condensed nature of Summer Sessions.

UCLA summer session fees are charged on a per-unit fee basis. The unit maximum for summer is 18 units total, whether taken in a single session or multiple, although this can be increased with a petition to the College of L&S at A316 Murphy Hall.

Financial aid is also available in summer; there is a unit minimum (6) and applications start in February, so don’t wait to apply for aid.

## [Summer at a Community College](#summer-at-a-community-college)

Taking summer courses at a **Community College** can be a low-cost and possibly local alternative for those who will be away from Los Angeles in the summer. Each community college releases its schedule for summer on different dates and enrollment is specific to the school. Community colleges only offer lower-division courses, so they can be a great way to complete GE requirements, language, or some lower-div prep courses, but in all cases you must consult with either the College (for GE/language) or the department to determine which courses will transfer to fulfill requirements.

Grades do not transfer from community colleges, although you must earn at least a C to get credit. Units will transfer until you reach 105 total units, after which time you can no longer accrue units from community college courses. This can be a good thing, as it can help keep your unit count below the maximum if you intend to take on an ambitious program or have taken many courses already. Course credit can apply but again, you must consult with the proper office to insure that the correct course for the requirement you wish to fulfill is being taken.

## [Summer at another University](#summer-at-another-university)

Summer courses can also be taken at **another 4-year university**. There are thousands of public and private universities in the United States that offer summer session; therefore all courses taken at any other university must be approved in advance by petition to the department (for major or minor courses) or the College (for GE/College requirements).

If taken at any other University of California campus, in addition to course credit, the units and grades will transfer and affect your UC GPA. If taken at any other university, units and course credit can transfer but the grades will not affect your UC GPA (although at least a “C” grade is required to earn credit). As with Community Colleges, a transcript must be sent to UCLA following completion of the courses.
