# Study Abroad

The IoES encourages students to explore the many opportunities for study abroad available through UCLA and other campuses and organizations.

## UC Education Abroad Program {#uc-education-abroad-program}

UC EAP is a UC-systemwide Education Abroad Program that specializes in semester or year-long study abroad at foreign universities. You can choose from hundreds of universities located in dozens of countries across the globe.

When choosing where to go, consider what is unique, special, and intriguing to you about the places you are considering and think about what sort of experience you want to have. Once you’ve figured that out, we here at the IoES can work with you and the EAP counselors to find the best fit for you. We can help figure out courses for you to take, so don’t become preoccupied with that.

For semester-length UC EAP programs, you will go, usually alone, to the foreign university and take the same courses with the resident population of students. It is an immersive experience in the culture, climate, and people of the location you choose. This type of cultural immersion is exciting and often a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, but it also requires maturity on the part of the participant as you will be away from nearly everything familiar to you for many months.

Because the Practicum occurs throughout senior year, we recommend that students plan for semester abroad programs like EAP to take place either during the Junior year, or in fall of a 5th year \(13th semester\) if that is viable for you. Fall is often favorable because you trade a fall quarter for a fall semester; spring semesters straddle the UCLA winter and spring quarter. However, this should be only one factor in your decision, which should also include the climate/season, finances, and other considerations.

## Travel Study {#travel-study}

Travel Study, like EAP, offers students a unique experience, but usually these programs are shorter, focus on a specific site or topic of study in a region, and the majority of students and instructors will be from U.S. universities. Programs as short as one week or as long as a semester are available through travel study programs.

UCLA offers some in the summer, although at the moment we do not have any environment-specific travel study options. UC Davis, on the other hand, has many terrific summer programs that go to a variety of locales. In addition, other universities offer travel study programs that are open to any students in the USA and there are also privately run organizations that offer travel study.

Students should check with counselors both in the department appropriate to the field of study and in UC EAP to help determine transferability of any non-UC program.

## UC Natural Reserve System: California Ecology and Conservation Field Course {#uc-natural-reserve-system-california-ecology-and-conservation-field-course}

The UC Natural Reserve System is a network of protected natural areas throughout California. Its 39 sites include more than 756,000 acres, making it the largest university-administered reserve system in the world. Most major state ecosystems are represented, from coastal tidepools to inland deserts, and lush wetlands to redwood forests. The reserves also serve as a gateway to more than a million acres of public lands. Founded in 1965 to provide undisturbed environments for research, education, and public service, the Natural Reserve System contributes to the understanding and wise stewardship of the earth.

The California Ecology and Conservation course brings together 27 students from across the UC system for seven weeks of intensive learning at NRS reserves. Guided by experienced field instructors, undergraduates transform into scientists by conducting independent research studies. Students learn to notice natural patterns, frame questions into feasible research projects, and practice standard techniques such as surveys of animal and plant populations. At the conclusion of each project, students analyze their data and present their findings to the class in oral presentations, posters, and reports. Students hone their research, public speaking, and scientific writing skills with constant practice and feedback. All the while, students gain a working familiarity with California’s diverse ecosystems while immersed in the NRS’s classrooms without walls.

California Ecology and Conservation is open to all University of California undergraduates in good standing with their home campus who have at least a 2.5 GPA and have passed an introductory ecology or biology course prior to applying for the program. Students receive 19 units of credit for the term; consult with your major and/or minor department for applicability of credit for your program. The program is offered in spring, summer, and fall.
