# Double Majors

Students wishing to double major are best served by identifying the two majors as early as possible in one’s academic career. The key to successfully double-majoring is planning in order to make sure the course load is manageable and to ensure completion within a reasonable time-to-degree, since nearly all double majors will exceed the unit maximum.

Double majors with BS in environmental science are always subject to approval by the College of L&S \(and if in another school at UCLA, such as HSSEAS or AA, approval by that school as well\).

There is a process to declaring a double major. The first step is to devise a plan that accommodates all the courses necessary to complete both majors as well as the other requirements of the school to which you belong. This plan should be vetted by the SAOs from each department in which you will major.

To officially declare a double major, you must complete all preparatory courses for both majors, and at least two unique upper-division courses for each, prior to declaring. At that point you will have both departments review and sign-off on your course plan and then submit that to the College \(and if applicable to the school to which you belong\) for approval.

Up to 5 upper-division courses may overlap between the requirements for the majors involved. There is no limit on lower-division course overlap. The rules for minors still apply: 20 total units must be unique to any minor.

## Other Minors {#other-minors}

In addition to the minor/concentration required of all environmental science majors, students are welcome to pursue any other minor offered at UCLA. The procedure for declaring a minor varies from minor to minor, so always check with the SAO for the department offering the minor.

One requirement is universal to all minors: 20 units must be unique to the minor \(not overlapping with one’s major or another minor\).
