# Environmental Health Concentration

## About the Minor {#about-the-minor-1}

[Environmental Health Sciences, Fielding School of Public Health](https://ehs.ph.ucla.edu/pages/)

Research in Environmental Health Sciences focus on the effects of biological, chemical and physical hazards in the environment on human and ecosystem health, and the means of managing these hazards. Coursework in pollutant sources, treatment, fate and management in the environment – soil, air, water, including urban environments – and the effect these pollutants have on human health is the primary focus of the coursework in this concentration.

SPECIAL NOTE: Unlike the other concentrations in the Environmental Science major, Environmental Health Sciences is NOT a minor. Students completing this concentration will NOT receive a notation on the transcript or diploma. However, students who successfully complete the concentration have been very successful professionally and especially in turning their experience into graduate school admissions. The EHS concentration allows only those few in the Environmental Science major to participate in courses that are otherwise only available to graduate students in Public Health. A high level of achievement in these graduate level courses is impressive to graduate schools in Public Health and related fields, and often yields strong recommendations from the faculty as well. A highly motivated undergraduate who does well in this concentration will absolutely not be disadvantaged by the lack of a minor on his or her record.
