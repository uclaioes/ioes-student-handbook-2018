# Conservation Biology Minor

## [About the Minor/Concentration](#about-the-minor-concentration-0)

[Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology](https://www.eeb.ucla.edu/)

The Conservation Biology minor is designed for students who wish to augment their major program of study with courses addressing issues central to the conservation and sustainability of biodiversity and natural ecosystem processes. The minor seeks to provide students with a greater depth of experience and understanding of the role that science can play in developing conservation policy. Ecosystem conservation, including focused studies of flora and fauna and the unique requirements of specific species for biodiversity is the primary focus of the minor.

Students are encouraged to join the EEB undergraduate email list.
