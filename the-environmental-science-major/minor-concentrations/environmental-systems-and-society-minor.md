# Environmental Systems and Society Minor

## [About the Minor](#about-the-minor-2)

[Institute of the Environment and Sustainability](https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/)

The Environmental Systems and Society minor is designed for students who wish to augment their major program of study with courses addressing the relationships between environmental science and associated social and political issues. The minor seeks to impart a deeper understanding of environmental systems related to air, land, water and biological resources. A main goal of the program is to provide students with a foundation for sound decision making as a professional and a citizen. Coursework focuses primarily in three areas: environmental policy and regulations; environmental management, particularly in the context of economics and business management; and sustainability practices and implementation.
