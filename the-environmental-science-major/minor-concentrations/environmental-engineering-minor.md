# Environmental Engineering Minor

## [About the Minor](#about-the-minor-0)

[Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, HSSEAS](http://www.cee.ucla.edu/)

The Environmental Engineering minor is designed for students who wish to augment their major program of study with an exposure to engineering methods applied to key environmental problems facing modern society in developed and developing countries. The minor also provides students with a brief experience and understanding of the roles that environmental engineering methods play in solving environmental problems. Research in environmental engineering focuses on the understanding and management of physical, chemical, and biological processes in the environment and in engineering systems. Primarily focuses on water issues, with key coursework in chemical fate and transport in aquatic environments, wastewater management, hydrology, environmental/chemical remediation, and related topics.

## [A Guide to the Environmental Engineering Minor](#a-guide-to-the-environmental-engineering-minor)

### General Comments

This minor was originally conceived as a component of the BS in Environmental Science, offered by the Institute of the Environment, but may be of interest to students from other programs.

There are no prerequisite “traps” in the list of courses. The required course CEE 153 has only a recommended prerequisite of MAE 103, but more than a decade of experience has shown that students can achieve well in CEE 153 without having taken MAE 103. All other courses used to satisfy the minor have at most CEE 153 as a prerequisite. However, EHS C125 and C164 do recommend additional chemistry courses.

Unless the twenty unique unit requirement for a minor is lifted, students in HSSEAS majors can use this minor to satisfy only two of the TBR requirements in Civil and Environmental Engineering.

The requirement for a minimum grade of C in each course may be appealed in the case of a C-, but generally not in the case of any D grade. Consideration of appeals in the case of a C- grade will take into account the student’s overall academic record.

### Acceptable Course Substitutes

The list of elective courses specified in the minor requirements is limited to courses that may be taken without prerequisites, but many other subjects are appropriate to satisfy this minor. Up to _three_ UCLA courses in the list below will be “automatically” approved as substitutes for the five upper-division elective requirements. Requests for more than three substitutions and for transferred courses will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Note that, because some of the courses listed below may have additional prerequisites, students should consult the instructors of these courses to determine if they have adequate preparation.

_Acceptable course substitutes:_

**AOS** 104 (acceptable as substitute for CEE 153, but not in addition to CEE 153), 141 (credit for both AOS 141 and CEE 163 will not be granted)

**CEE** 110, 150, 151, 152, 156B, 157A, 157B, 157C, 157L, 157M, 163 **ChE** 100, 101A, 101B, 101C, 102A, 102B, 106, 113, C119, C140 (credit for both MAE 105A

and ChE 102A will not be granted) **EHS** C152D **ENV** M114, M134, M153, 157 **EPSS** 101, C113

**MAE** 103, 105A, 105D, 133A, 136, 150A, 150D, 174, 182A, 182B, 182C

#### Undergraduate Research Opportunities in Environmental Engineering

Students interested in participating in research in the area of environmental engineering are encouraged to contact directly the faculty instructors of the environmental engineering courses to see what research opportunities may be available.

#### Graduate Study in Environmental Engineering

Students wishing to enter a graduate program in environmental engineering should plan to take several additional courses. The following are the required preparatory courses for admission to the Environmental Engineering Masters Degree program at UCLA:

Chemistry and Biochemistry 20A, 20B, 20L; Mathematics 32A, 32B, 33A, 33B; Physics 1A/4AL, 1B; Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering 103, 105A; Civil and Environmental Engineering 151 or 153. The Chemistry and Biochemistry 14 A/B/BL series, and the Physics 6 A/B series are also acceptable, but the Mathematics 3 A/B series does not lead to the differential equations course 33B, so students are advised to take the 31 A/B series. Any course that includes thermodynamics is acceptable in place of MAE 105A. Note that MAE 103 and 105A, and CEE 151 and 153 are all acceptable requirements for the Environmental Engineering Minor.

Environmental Engineering Masters degree programs at universities other than UCLA should have entrance requirements similar to those of UCLA, but students are encouraged to obtain information specific to the schools to which they plan to apply.

Students interested in environmental engineering careers should also take the Fundamentals of Engineering Exam (previously called the Engineer-in-Training Exam) - see [http://ncees.org/exams/fe-exam/](http://ncees.org/exams/fe-exam/). Students without an accredited Bachelors Degree can take this exam (in spite of what the website implies). Once the Master’s Degree is completed there is no issue about a non-engineering Bachelors Degree and students can eventually proceed to obtain the Professional Engineers license.
