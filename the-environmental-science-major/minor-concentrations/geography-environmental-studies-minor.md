# Geography/Environmental Studies Minor

## [About the Minor](#about-the-minor-3)

[Department of Geography](http://www.geog.ucla.edu/)

The Geography/Environmental Studies minor is intended for students interested in environmental issues and emphasizes a systems approach to gaining a causal understanding of major environmental problems facing our society and the world at large. The uniqueness of the minor lies in its geographical perspective on the impact, at various geographical scales, of human activity on natural systems and on the implications of global environmental change on local, regional, and global human systems.
