# Minor/Concentrations

## [About the Minor/Concentration](#about-the-minor-concentration)

The Minor/Concentration provides depth and specific instruction in a particular field of the student’s greatest interest within Environmental Science. The concentration is required of all Environmental Science majors, and students earn a minor on the transcript and diploma when they graduate in six of the seven options.

## [Choosing a Minor/Concentration](#choosing-a-minor-concentration)

Students typically decide which minor/concentration to choose based on experiences in the upper-division coursework for the major. To aid in that discovery we recommend choosing the major courses of greatest interest as early as possible to help decide a direction. Most students determine their concentration by the end of the sophomore year or early in the junior year. Students are encouraged to declare the minor prior to reaching 150 total units; after reaching 150 units students will have to make an appointment with their general academic counseling unit (CAC/AAP/Honors) for approval.

While the minors provide greater depth in a particular field, they should not be viewed as determining one’s future. The minor/concentration can help students enter a particular field for graduate school or for a professional opportunity, but should always be viewed as potentially opening doors, but not closing others. While a student choosing, for example, Environmental Engineering may go on to become an engineer, the option is still open to pursue public health, law, or almost any other path.

## [Minor Unit Requirements](#minor-unit-requirements)

All minor/concentrations, with a little planning, will include the same number of courses. There is no longer or shorter path; all can be completed with 20 units that are unique to the minor. Typically this means that if a minor has 6 courses, one course can overlap with another part of one’s program (major or another minor); if it has 7 courses, two can overlap. However, the units are key, so courses that provide fewer than 4 units may change the number of courses one needs to reach 20 unique units in the minor.

## [Declaring the Minor/Concentration](#declaring-the-minor-concentration)

Declaring a minor is usually a simple process. First, students should consult with the IoES SAO to declare the concentration, which then tracks progress in DARS. Royce will explain any additional steps the student must take prior to declaring the minor with the department that offers it (also detailed in the sections for the minors here).

Substitution requests for minors offered by a department other than the IoES must be made to and approved by that department. Each department has its own preferences for submitting such petitions. Consult with the department SAO for instructions. See the Appendix for a list of all departmental SAO contact information.

## [Career Paths – Study What Interests You!](#career-paths-study-what-interests-you)

For many of you, as young scientists, choosing a career path may feel like a daunting challenge, and the decision of what to study to set yourself up for that career equally or even more intimidating. But here’s the good news: there are many, many fantastic career paths available to you after you graduate, whether you continue in environmental science or not, and the minor you pick will not, by itself, predict, or limit, your future. You should feel free to study what interests you, not what you think you need to study because it’s the only path to that exact right job.

According to a recent report by the U.S. Department of labor, on average people tend to change jobs _11 times_ between the ages of 18 and 44, and will change careers altogether two or three times in their lifetime. Your undergraduate education path will not define your career path, rather, it will provide you with a strong background as a scientist or professional in general for you to go forward and discover what it is you want to do.

This is not to say there aren’t reasons to potentially pick one minor over another. This is including whether you plan to potentially go on to a graduate program in a particular scientific discipline or for a professional program; there may be prerequisites you will need to have taken in the program subject area. But even if you decide to change course later, there are almost always opportunities to build the background needed for graduate study in a different field. Just because you minor in conservation biology does not mean you can never get a PhD in climate science! The important thing is to find a course of study will be passionate about, do well, and keep moving forward. Your choice of minor is an important first step, but only a first step toward figuring out what you will do next!
