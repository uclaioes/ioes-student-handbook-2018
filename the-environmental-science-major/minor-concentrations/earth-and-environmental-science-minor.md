# Earth and Environmental Science Minor

## [About the Minor](#about-the-minor-4)

[Department of Earth Planetary and Space Sciences](http://epss.ucla.edu/)

In the Earth and Environmental Science minor students study the interaction of the solid Earth, oceans, and atmosphere with human activities. The minor provides background in Earth sciences that is especially appropriate for students intending to become K through 12 teachers in Earth, physical, or life sciences. It may also be of interest to students who plan careers in business, dentistry, environmental sciences, government, journalism, law, medicine, or public health.

A minimum of 20 upper division units applied toward the minor requirements must be in addition to units applied toward major or minor requirements in another department or program. Each minor course must be taken for a letter grade, and students must have an overall grade-point average of 2.0 or better.

Additional preparation required

* Mathematics 3C or 32A
* Physics 6C or5B or 1C **OR** Chemistry 14C or 30A

Minor requirements (7 courses, 28 units, two course overlap permitted)

* Earth and Space Sciences 1, one course from 5, 13, 15, or 61.
* Choose five from: Earth and Space Sciences 101, 112, C113, 139, 150, 153. Consult with the EPS Sci Department for other applicable courses.

## [Course Descriptions](#course-descriptions-5)

### Earth Planetary and Space Sciences

#### 1\. Introduction to Earth Science. (5)
Lecture, three hours; laboratory, two hours; field days. Not open to students with credit for or currently enrolled in course 100. Elements of Earth science; study of Earth materials; nature and interpretation of geologic evidence; study of geologic processes; historical aspects of geology. Mandatory field trips introduce students to solving of geologic problems in field. P/NP or letter grading.

#### 5\. Environmental Geology of Los Angeles. (4)
Lecture, three hours; discussion, two hours; field trips. Geologic hazards and natural resources of greater Los Angeles region. Topics include Los Angeles geologic hazards such as earthquakes, landslides, and floods; Southern California oil fields; gold and gem mining in region; local beach processes; and Los Angeles water resource problems. Field trips to San Andreas fault, California aqueduct, active landslides, and historic gold mines. P/NP or letter grading.

#### 13\. Natural Disasters. (5)
Lecture, three hours; discussion, one hour; one field day. Global urbanization together with historical demographic population shift to coastal areas, especially around Pacific Ocean’s “Ring of Fire,” are placing increasingly large parts of this planet’s human population at risk due to earthquakes, volcanos, and tsunamis. Global climate change combines with variety of geologic processes to create enhanced risks from catastrophic mass movements (e.g., landslides), hurricanes, floods, and fires. Exploration of physical processes behind natural disasters and discussion of how these natural events affect quality of human life. P/NP or letter grading.

#### 15\. Blue Planet: Introduction to Oceanography. (5)
Lecture, three hours; laboratory, two hours. Not open for credit to students with credit for or currently enrolled in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology 25. General introduction to geological, physical, chemical, and biological processes and history of Earth’s global ocean system. P/NP or letter grading.

#### 61\. Geologic Maps. (4)
Lecture, two hours; laboratory, three hours; five field days. Enforced requisite: course 1. Planning, creation, and interpretation of geologic maps, including both practical and philosophical problems that arise. Topographic and geologic mapping in field. Interpretation of published maps in laboratory. P/NP or letter grading.

#### 101\. Earth’s Energy: Diminishing Fossil Resources and Prospects for Sustainable Future. (4)
Lecture, three hours; laboratory, two hours; two optional field trips. Preparation: one lower-division atmospheric sciences, chemistry, Earth sciences, or physics course. Earth’s energy resources (fossil fuels and alternatives) from Earth science and sustainability perspective. P/NP or letter grading.

#### 112\. Structural Geology. (5)
Lecture, three hours; laboratory, six hours. Requisites: courses 1, 61. Recommended: course 51. Planar and linear structures at different scales in sedimentary, metamorphic, and igneous rocks. Faults and folds, their description, classification, and kinematic and dynamic analysis. Deformation, strength, fracture, and rheological properties of rocks. P/NP or letter grading.

#### C113. Biological and Environmental Geochemistry. (4)
Lecture, three hours. Requisites: Chemistry 14A and 14B (or 20A and 20B), Mathematics 3A, 3B, and 3C (or 31A and 31B). Recommended: at least one lower-division Earth, planetary, and space sciences course. Intended for junior/senior life and physical sciences students. Study of chemistry of Earth’s surface environment and interplay between biology, human activity, and geology. Introduction to origin and composition of Earth, including atmosphere, crust, and hydrosphere. Examination of how these reservoirs are affected by biological cycles and feedbacks to biological evolution and diversity. Local and global-scale movements of biologically important elements like carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus. Concurrently scheduled with course C213. P/NP or letter grading.
