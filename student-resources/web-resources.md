# Web Resources

The Institute of the Environment and Sustainability features an excellent website that contains a multitude of information for students.

In particular, the section for the B.S. in Environmental Science for “Current Students” contains resources that should be consulted by all majors regularly as you pursue your undergraduate studies, such as the most recent program plan, information about the Senior Practicum, course lists, awards, scholarships, email lists and social media connections.

## Piazza Email List {#piazza-email-list}

All majors should join the IoES undergraduate mailing list. We use a web service called Piazza, which allows you to tailor the frequency of email messages (we recommend the daily digest format). Piazza also keeps a complete, searchable archive of all messages that can be accessed on any web-capable device via the Piazza website.

Messages contain useful information for undergraduates and alumni alike, including things like new courses, invitations to events on and off campus, internship and job opportunities, research and lab opportunities, volunteering, campus clubs, study abroad, and more.

To join, simply create an account and join “IoES undergraduate advising.” If you’re already a Piazza user from one of your courses, you need only join the above “class” to start getting our messages.
