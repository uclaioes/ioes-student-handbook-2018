# Tell Your Story

What awards \(fellowships, scholarships, recognition, honors, etc.\) have you received? What work or research have you done in the environmental sector? Increasing the exposure of your successes to our broad audience creates a halo effect that creates more opportunities for all IoES students, including yourself.

What sets IoES apart is our focus on sharing what we discover with the world. We bring environmental science directly to the public and decision-makers who can truly make a difference, with:

* Social media across multiple platforms:  [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/uclaioes), [Facebook](https://facebook.com/uclaioes/), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/uclaioes)
* [Collaboration](https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/in-the-news/) with major media outlets in print, radio and television
* Engaging and collaborative [public events](https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/events/)
* Featured [stories](https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/magazine/) about our innovative students, faculty members, and centers

For students and alumni we also provide these channels of communication to facilitate discussion and networking:

* An online platform for students to publicly share IoES related [projects](https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/projects/?ioesyear=&ioestype=practicum-project) and results
* A [LinkedIn Group](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/4509089) to share professional/academic opportunities, tips, and advice
* A [Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/141172551155/) to foster discussion and share events and updates related to sustainability from inside and outside the UCLA IoES community
* An [Alumni Spotlight](https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/envisci/alumni-profiles/) that showcases what our former students are now doing
