## IoES Exclusive Research Grants & Scholarships

The IoES administers a grant and scholarship for undergraduate students to support their work at the IoES.

A $4,000 annual grant is awarded to one Environmental Science student each year. The funds will be used to pay the salary of a student working as a research assistant under supervision of a faculty member at UCLA.
