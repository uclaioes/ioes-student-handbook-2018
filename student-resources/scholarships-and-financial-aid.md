## UCLA Financial Aid {#ucla-financial-aid}

UCLA offers a variety of financial aid options to students, including grants, fee waivers, scholarships, work-study, subsidized and unsubsidized loans. More information on [UCLA financial aid can be found here](http://www.financialaid.ucla.edu/).

Eligibility for most forms of financial aid requires the filing of a Free Application for Federal Student Aid \(FAFSA\). You can [file a FAFSA here](https://fafsa.ed.gov/).
