# People

At the IoES we pride ourselves on being accessible and providing exceptional, individualized academic guidance for our students.

## Royce Dieckmann, Student Affairs Officer

The first stop for all students in the major is the Student Affairs Officer. Even if you don’t believe you need help or have any questions, we urge you to schedule an annual meeting with Royce. This handbook may answer many questions but an in-person meeting should be viewed like your annual checkup, but unlike with your medical doctors, we promise it won’t be painful! Royce is available for appointments through an easy online scheduling tool (Calendly) to discuss all of your academic questions, including curriculum planning, enrollment, course substitutions, change of major/minor/concentration, how to get involved with research, internships, or volunteering, graduate school planning, DARS fixes, or any other questions, problems, or issues you may experience.

## [Noah Garrison, Environmental Science Practicum Director](#noah-garrison-environmental-science-practicum-director)

If you aren’t already familiar with Noah Garrison from the Introduction to Environmental Science course, Environment M10, you will be as you transition to your junior year and attend the Junior Class Retreat, while as seniors you will get to know him very well as the IoES Practicum Director. Noah is an invaluable resource available for consultation about a variety of topics in the field, but in particular if you have questions about graduate or professional school (he is also a practicing environmental attorney), career pathways, or getting involved in research or departmental honors, it will be well worth your while to make an appointment to speak with him!
