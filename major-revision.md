# About the Revised Environmental Science Major

The Environmental Science major graduated its first student in 2008. After 10 years as a major, a couple of factors provided the impetus for the department leadership to investigate changes that would improve the experience of students while in school and make students even more competitive for graduate programs and jobs after graduation. 

We based the changes largely on feedback we’ve received from students. We perform a bi-annual survey of our alumni, and they provided feedback on the strengths and weaknesses of the program. In addition, in 2017 we underwent our 8-year departmental review, which brought in faculty from across departments at UCLA and faculty from comparable universities across the country to evaluate our programs and provide suggestions. Similarly our change in leadership brought fresh eyes to the program and motivated revision to make our Environmental Science program second to none in the world. 

Those elements that are our strengths have remained unchanged or in fact been strengthened and emphasized in the program. Those areas that were weaknesses we’ve addressed in a couple of ways. We had three primary goals for the revision of the major:

1.	Provide the skills and knowledge that were lacking or needed improvement under the existing program, to make our students the premier candidates for jobs and graduate programs. We’ve added a dedicated course in GIS, a course in specific environmental policy and regulation, and a course in advanced statistics, data management, and programming, all of which will provide extremely marketable skills. 

2.	Make navigating the major simpler; by removing the individual categories we have opened up the options for students to take many different courses in any term. This should alleviate the problem of students having few or no options in a term, especially as students near graduation. We expect this will alleviate some angst during each enrollment session and will help students graduate in a timely manner. 

3.	Create a better sense of cohesion and camaraderie amongst the majors, particularly by cohort, by introducing required courses intended to be taken in particular stages of advancement. Ideally Environmental Science majors will have at least one course each academic year where the majority or entirety of the class will be other Environmental Science majors, primarily from the same cohort. Complementing this will be the Jr Retreat, a complete cohort camping trip during zero week of the junior/3rd year of study. 

We hope that you will find the revised major a significant improvement and the changes helpful as you make your way through your undergraduate program. 

**Acknowlegements

The IoES wishes to sincerely thank all of those who put so much time and effort into this major revision. All of the many committees who read, considered and commented on the changes provided invaluable assistance in its creation. 

In particular, the IoES would like to thank Professor Greg Okin, who chaired the curriculum revision working group and the B.S. Advisory Committee and was a model of mission management; the members of the curriculum working group: Jenny Jay, Rob Eagle, Alan Barreca, Noah Garrison, and Cully Nordby, and the contributions of the other members of the Environmental Science B.S. Advisory Committee who added valuable comments and tweaks to the plan: Ulli Seibt, Malcolm Gordon, Yifang Zhu, and Aradhna Tripati.
