## Course Groupings

The following groupings of courses are meant to help you plan your major courses based upon your interests and goals. 
The courses are grouped by topic but across departmental boundaries. These groupings are meant to be suggestive of possible pathways and helpful for planning, but they should not be seen as proscriptive. 

These courses will complement (and in some cases overlap) courses in the minor/concentration of your interest.
