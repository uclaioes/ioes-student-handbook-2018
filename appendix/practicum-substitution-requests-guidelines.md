# Practicum substitution requests guidelines

**Students wishing to pursue an independent research project in lieu of participating on a Practicum team should contact the IoES Practicum Director, Noah Garrison at **[ngarrison@ioes.ucla.edu](mailto:ngarrison@ioes.ucla.edu)

1. Students wishing to pursue an independent project for the practicum must enroll in Environment 180A in fall quarter of the academic year in which you will graduate. There is no substitute available for 180A. This is a stand-alone course that provides a variety of important skills that are not provided elsewhere.
2. You must be in good academic standing, and have a minimum GPA of 3.0 or better in the major.
3. You must submit a satisfactory prospectus \(proposal of your project\) to the IoES faculty committee and to your proposed advisor by \[date varies based on date group projects will be assigned\]. The prospectus should be 2-3 pages with references, and include the following components:
   1. Background: What is the motivation and context for the project? Place the problem in its broader scientific, environmental, and policy \(if applicable\) context, and include a summary of what is known about the problem already.
   2. Explain who the audience is: Who will find this project important? What agency or group would be interested in the project results?
   3. Clearly state your objectives. What question are you asking?
   4. Include a clear timeline showing the steps you will take to complete the project and your approximate time of completion for each. A condensed version of this timeline should be provided on the contract you submit to your advisor.
   5. Specifics regarding the project: What kind of data are you collecting? What methods are you using? Where will the research take place \(e.g. field site\)? What type of analysis will you be using? What are your expected results?
   6. A brief summary of the support you have or will need to carry out the project. This includes who your advisor is, and your access to the tools you need to get your project done.
   7. References
4. The project must have some depth and measure of completion. Merely assisting on projects in a lab or similar will not suffice, and although you can help with more than one project, we expect products \(below\) focused on one project.
5. Progress Report: For projects lasting longer than one quarter \(the most common situation\), you will need to submit a progress report before the end of the first quarter. This can focus on skills learned and measurements made, as well as preliminary results and if necessary, changes in your research plan. This is a formal requirement, and should be 2-3 pages submitted to the department and to your advisor. Students who fail to submit an acceptable progress report will not be permitted to enroll in the second term of Environment 199 until the progress report has been submitted.
6. In order for the project to be accepted as a substitution for Environment 180B and C to fulfill the Practicum component of the Environmental Science major, it will need to satisfy the following criteria:
   1. You must submit an acceptable written final project report, and make an acceptable oral presentation of your results. The paper and presentation should be complete, and include a motivation and background section that covers its broader context, methods, results, conclusions, and suggestions for further work. The work should be placed in a broader context that includes environmental impacts as well as the implications for specific policy, regulatory, economic and/or social issues where applicable.
   2. The oral presentation will normally be made before or after the presentations made by the 180B/C students, typically during the final Environmental Science Colloquium class meeting in spring quarter. It must be a scientific presentation of your project results delivered in a clear, well crafted and professional manner that is on time \(does not go over the allotted time limit, and uses at least 90% of the allotted time\). If your presentation does not pass, you will have one more chance to make an oral presentation in front of one or more appropriate faculty.
   3. The prospectus and final paper should be approved by your advisor, and the final paper should be accompanied by a short statement from your advisor certifying that you performed work at least equivalent to 10 units of independent research. It is critical that your advisor read and understand the commitment they are making to you and your project; the practicum project goes well beyond the expectations of a normal 199 independent study.
   4. The Environmental Science Faculty Advisory Committee will determine whether the final project is a satisfactory substitution for the Practicum. If for some reason you are unable to complete the project and satisfy these criteria for course substitution, you may still be eligible to apply the unit credit towards upper division credit for your major by petition.

Deadlines and important information for pursuing an independent project for the Practicum:

**Prospectus Deadline**:

You will need to have your prospectus document completed by \[the week that group projects are assigned\]. The deadline to submit a final, polished prospectus to the faculty committee of the IoES will be the end of \[the week that group projects are assigned\] and you must secure a faculty advisor by that time. This is accomplished much more easily with a strong prospectus. Email a copy to rdieckmann@ioe.ucla.edu to distribute to the faculty committee.

**Contract Course Deadline**: Friday of week two \(winter & spring\)

You will need to submit a signed copy of the following contract with your project advisor at the beginning of winter quarter or earlier, along with your course enrollment contract, before the end of week 2 of winter quarter to the IoES SAO \(Royce\) in Life Science 2308. You will create the Environment 199 course on your MyUCLA site, by choosing the link for “contract courses” and following the step-by-step instructions found there. The 199 is 4 units per quarter, with a mandatory grade basis \(not P/NP\). You will need to also submit a course contract to enroll in the 199 units for spring quarter.

* **Honors**: An independent practicum project is NOT a departmental honors project. However, if you are enrolled with College Honors, the 180A/B/C courses already automatically grant units with College Honors. Students who qualify to apply for the Departmental Honors Program will be contacted with guidelines and instructions for applying to that program.
* **Alternatives**: Students interested in the Field Biology Quarter or the Marine Biology Quarter should consult with Royce Dieckmann, SAO in the IoES, prior to the deadline for independent project prospectuses, and with the counselors in the Ecology & Evolutionary Biology department regarding availability and admission to those programs. Any student contemplating a project with faculty outside of UCLA or that will take place at another institution must consult with the IoES prior to undertaking any such project and before the week 4 deadline for independent project prospectus.

Students whose proposals are rejected by the IoES faculty committee will be placed with 180B/C groups.
