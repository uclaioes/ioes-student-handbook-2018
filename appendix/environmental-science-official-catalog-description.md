# Environmental Science Official Catalog Description

**Undergraduate Study**

The Environmental Science major is a designated capstone major. In collaboration with a local agency or nonprofit institution, students work individually and in groups to complete projects that require them to integrate many of the skills, principles, theories, and concepts they have learned throughout the curriculum and apply them to real systems. Students are expected to contribute meaningfully to the analysis and solution of particular environmental science issues involving multiple disciplines and stakeholders with different perspectives. Those completing the major should possess critical thinking skills, problem-solving abilities, and familiarity with essential computational, data collection, and analysis skills, as well as demonstrate effective oral and written communication skills. Graduates should also be able to identify key ethical issues and analyze the consequences of various professional dilemmas, as well as work productively as part of a team.

**Environmental Science BS**

**Capstone Major**

The Environmental Science BS program represents strong collaboration between the Institute of the Environment and Sustainability and the Departments of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences; Civil and Environmental Engineering; Earth, Planetary, and Space Sciences; Ecology and Evolutionary Biology; Environmental Health Sciences; and Geography. The program is designed for students who are deeply interested in the study of environmental science. There are two components to the program, and both must be completed to receive the degree. The first component, the Environmental Science major, requires completion of lower-division requirements grounded in basic natural sciences, a six-course upper-division environmental science requirement reflecting the disciplinary breadth of environmental science, two social sciences/humanities courses, participation in an ongoing environmental science colloquium, and completion of an environmental science practicum. The second component is a minor or concentration in one of seven environmental science areas, each associated with a particular department. With assistance from IoES staff, students must formally apply to and be accepted by the associated department to receive the minor.
