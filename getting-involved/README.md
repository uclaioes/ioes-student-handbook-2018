# Getting Involved

When school is in session, UCLA effectively becomes a city of 80,000 people. With its commitment to health and sustainability, the campus has become a living laboratory, taking on issues from renewable energy to water reuse to food sourcing to biodiversity to creating a healthy workforce and more.

The diverse population of greater L.A. is at 18.68 million and growing, yet there is a wealth of nature all around. From the Santa Monica Mountains to the tide pools of Palos Verdes, Los Angeles represents the frontier of urban humanity’s interaction with nature. Water, food supply, energy, pollution and environmental justice are all part of the equation. Many UCLA students engage off campus by volunteering with community groups, teaching LA’s youth about sustainability and the environment, or simply getting out in nature. There are many ways to get involved. Sign up, try it out, make friends, find your passion!
