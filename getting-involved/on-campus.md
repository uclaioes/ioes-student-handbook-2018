## [Environmental Student Network](#environmental-student-network)

The Environmental Student Network (ESN) is a UCLA campus student organization dedicated to providing networking opportunities for Environmental Science majors and anyone who wants to be involved in the environmental field in general. ESN additionally provides a setting for environmentally conscious students to come together; ESN holds volunteer events, socials, and hikes throughout the year in an effort to provide students opportunities to become further involved. All majors are welcome—all that's necessary to participate is a passion for the environment and a desire to help!

## [Sustainability Talks](#sustainability-talks)

Sustainability Talks is a student-led speaker series offered each Fall quarter as Environment 185A, a 1-unit, pass/no pass course. Student Co-Directors line-up professionals, academics, and activists in sustainable fields such as energy, climate change, air quality, environmental justice, food, transportation, fashion, entertainment, public health technology, film and more. This course is a great way to meet other students, hear from people at the cutting edge of sustainability, and to get ideas for volunteer and internship opportunities.

This course may be applied toward the Colloquium requirement. Together with Sustainability Action Research (below) the courses (Environment 185 A/B/C) may be applied toward the Environmental Systems and Society minor.

## [Sustainability Action Research Program](#sustainability-action-research-program)

Sustainability Action Research (SAR) is a student-initiated, student-designed, and student-facilitated research program offered through the IoES. In a two-quarter sequence of classes in winter and spring (Environment 185 A/B), students on SAR teams are partnered with a campus stakeholder to research, rethink, investigate, and tackle UCLA’s greatest sustainability issues. This program is a great way to get involved in real-world research and is kind of like the Practicum, but with UCLA as the client! The program is open to anyone and you enroll by applying to be a team member (185A) or a team leader (185B). Each year there are 7-8 teams of 5-7 students working with Facilities, Housing, Health System, Transportation, Dining, and others. Enrollment may be competitive depending on demand.

## [UCLA Sustainability Office Internships](#ucla-sustainability-office-internships)

The UCLA Sustainability Office has an ongoing, open call for student volunteers wanting to get involved in campus projects. Opportunities range from one-time activities to short term or term projects. You may be able to work directly with Nurit Katz, UCLA Chief Sustainability Officer, or Bonny Bentzin, Deputy Chief Sustainability Officer. Both are wonderful women and are great resources, especially if you are thinking of a career in sustainability.

## [The Green Initiative Fund](#the-green-initiative-fund)

Have your own ideas about improving sustainability on campus? You can apply for funding to make them happen through The Green Initiative Fund (TGIF), a grant-making fund for sustainability projects on UCLA’s campus. Roughly, $200,000 per year is available for student-initiated sustainability projects on campus. Projects are selected by a committee consisting of students, faculty, and staff in which students have the majority vote. TGIF is funded by a $4 per quarter student fee. The goal of TGIF is to enable and empower students to take an active role in making UCLA a leader in sustainability. TGIF provides much needed funding for projects that reduce UCLA’s negative impact on the environment. Past projects have varied from solar panels on Ackerman to hydration stations, student events, and more.

## [Student Organizations](#student-organizations)

Among the hundreds of UCLA student groups, there are over 25 dedicated to environmental issues. Some are listed here on the UCLA Sustainability website: [https://www.sustain.ucla.edu/our-initiatives/student-organizations](https://www.sustain.ucla.edu/our-initiatives/student-organizations/) For a full list, check out the “Environmental“ category on the USAC page: [https://sa.ucla.edu/RCO/public/search](https://sa.ucla.edu/RCO/public/search).

Whether you want to garden, visit high school classrooms, run the UCLA Farmer’s Market, advocate for fossil-Free UCLA or fair-trade products, run for USAC officer positions, or just about anything else you can imagine - there is a student group oust there for you. And if there isn’t one? Start one! Student groups are a great way to meet people and to get involved in activities on and off campus.

## [USAC and ASUCLA](#usac-and-asucla)

Both the Undergraduate Student Association Council (USAC) and the Associated Students of UCLA (ASUCLA) have demonstrated their commitment to sustainability. USAC made sustainability a key area of concentration and has begun to promote sustainability efforts in the residence halls, as well as throughout the undergraduate student government offices. ASUCLA, the largest student-run student union in the country, agreed to develop a policy on sustainability as well as sustainability plan, all because of student efforts.
